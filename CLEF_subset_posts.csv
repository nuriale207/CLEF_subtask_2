subject100,0, - i almost only play marathon/huge. i enjoy slowly building up an empire and waging lengthy wars. there is a fair bit of waiting but selecting 'auto-end turn' in settings helps quite a bit. i've heard good things about extended eras mod (which speeds up production but slows down research). not sure if that has the compatibility issues you mention though.
subject100,0," - building improvements definitely does scale with speed. without liberty policies or the pyramids, for instance, it can be 20ish turns (i can't recall the exact number offhand) to build a farm. while it makes for slow-going early on, you can stay engaged by exploring and hunting barbarians. further, i like that the slow speed forces you to make optimal decisions. if you prioritize your improvements sub-optimally on marathon, you cost yourself 40-60 turns of food or production, for example. i'm not certain if religion scales (because i'm not too well-versed on the math behind religion mechanics, and because i don't have much experience on slower speeds), but i believe the speed scales everything that costs faith (for instance, needing 600 faith to found a religion/spawn a great prophet)."
subject100,0," - this sounds like it would work best as a scenario where you start with a large empire, and have to juggle outside threats with internal happiness. i wouldn't want this in the general game, though. it would just make going wide, colonizing other landmasses, and going for domination victories even harder (and there is already too much bias for tall science turtles). i played rome total war and medieval total war 2 quite a bit back in the day, and those games had a similar mechanic (happiness tied to garrison strength, distance to the capital (and in m:tw2, religion). on higher difficulties, the mechanic just felt like a sloppy way to give ai a boost and make world conquest require more 'hacks' (like destroying +food buildings when you capture a city to keep populations low). it didn't make for strategic decisions or fun gameplay."
subject100,0," - i'd assume rrs are generally a gpt net loss for a remote city without production buildings/improvements/internal trade routes. adding railroads gets you 0.05 gpt (.2 production bonus x 25% conversion) for each point of production you have. i can't recall if the gold building multipliers occur before or after the production-to-gold occurs, but even if you have all 3 buildings, you can double your assumptions to 0.094 gpt (0.2 x 25% conversion x 88% buildings) per point of production. assuming you need 6 gpt to offset costs of a railroad (assume the rr crosses 3 of your tiles to reach the remote city, and 3 tiles to leave the connecting city), you would need a ton of production (over 60 using the second set of assumptions) if you are only focused on the gpt effects of rr building. that being said, i usually build rrs (a) for the strategic purposes of faster troop movement, (b) because usually late-gamte 5-6 gpt isn't mattering too much either way, and (c) because if your remote city is getting food bonuses and growing, you will at some point want happiness and science buildings, your ""gold focus"" notwithstanding. caveat - answering this from work and not in-game, and i never remember how multipliers work off the top of my head."
subject100,0," - 1. population drives several things. first, it allows you to work physical tiles in your cities. those tiles provide a variety of bonuses (food, gold, production). second, population provides values as a mechanic for determining the city's output (in the city management screen) for various resources. for instance, a citizen produces science and a citizen increases the value of city connections. generally you want to grow your population as large as your happiness can handle. 2. certain buildings provide 'specialist' slots. one of the first ones you will have available via research is the market. in the same way that your citizens can work tiles around a city, citizens can also work specialist slots in your building. these specialist slots are more 'specialized' (shocking), and generally have lower yields, but they also provide great person points. so working the slot in a market provides wealth and great merchant points. all citizens, including specialists, generate unhappiness. 3. tall = a few (think 3 or 4) high-population cities. wide = many (think 6+) mid-population cities. forward-settle is when you have a settler found a city near an opponent's borders. usually it is done to claim resources and to limit where an opponent can settle. the ai will get mad at you and often attack if you settle closer to their cities than to your own. 4. tradition is more popular because on higher difficulties it is easier to play tall. on higher difficulties, ais start with lots of bonuses and technologies, so they often settle most of the best land before you can. therefore, it is easier to only settle a few cities, and make them all very large. tradition policies encourage this. further, tradition has more multiplicative policies (e.g., +%), and this scales better as cities get larger. generally both tradition (for tall) and liberty (for wide) are good as first policy choices. 5. warmonger penalties don't last forever, but some penalties (like wiping out a civ) last longer and are more negative than other penalties (like just being at war and trading casualties). wiping out an entire civ, or an entire continent worth of civs, might last for most of the game. 6. general advice - watch 'lets play' videos on youtube and read the threads. i'm still learning stuff after 1,000 hours played, and i think most people are the same. more specific - try playing every game with the goal of learning a specific aspect of the game, regardless of whether or not you win. so start a game where you want to have a strong religion - focus on getting your faith up, on how to spread religion to another city, how trade routes matter, etc. next game, focus on building a solid military, and engaging a war where you don't lose many units. the game can be overwhelming when you try to focus on everything. i also recommend playing slower speeds (epic/marathon), because each turn you have fewer decisions to make each turn. so instead of deciding which building you need in 6 cities, you can focus on each city in a separate turn."
subject100,0," - the justification for the mechanic, if i had to guess, is that, for most of human history, when one power took a city from another power, the winner would sack the city, and enslave or murder its citizens. even into the 20th century, many cities were bombed into oblivion during invasions and/or most of the population would flee prior to the arrival of invaders. i think it is a useful mechanic. otherwise, an invader would have a powerful city capable of quickly replenishing any lost troops (after the unrest period). instead, you typically have a decent city with some infrastructure, but you need to wait several turns for the population to increase before the city becomes useful for producing current military units. it is a strategy when going for domination victory to let an especially large city change hands a few times before you capture it for good. that way, you end up with a small pop city (like in your example) that is only briefly in unrest and does not create much unhappiness. you are correct that tourism is the only way to reduce/eliminate this issue."
subject100,0," - i'm in the same boat (recent tiny person), so congratulations! i recently downloaded the unlimited xp from barbarians (i think its called barbarian exp - [something]. if you search on the steam community site, it is one of the first hits. it hasn't felt totally overpowered (though you could easily abuse it to farm barbarian camps without clearing them to have range/logistics archers), but it has boosted my early military enough with the gold/culture bonuses from getting kills to feel like i haven't fallen behind. and it means, if you keep units alive, that you will have some heavily promoted units to run roughshod over the world in later eras. i usually never open honor, but with this mod and some more warlike races (like the aztecs), i've had some fun honor/domination games. balancing early happiness is a new challenge that your typical 4-city tall game doesn't provide. i also recently downloaded the communitas map mod. i typically only play a few map types (i don't care much for maps that are either not circular or are too non-earth-like, like the oval ones), and communitas has made for some interesting games by providing unique maps. for instance, the game i'm playing now (the aztec-honor one) has some unique mountain ranges that create more choke points than a typical fractal or continents map would. there are also more inlets, so once i get to frigates and battleships, my navy will be able to reach more inland cities than typical. next on my list is to try some lotr and game of thrones maps. i've seen a few linked on this board, and they seem cool."
subject100,0," - i'd actually recommend not improving a tile that you can't use (unless you place a fort, or for situational improvements like a string of polynesian moais). you get no benefit, but if you are invaded, the enemy can pillage the tile and get healed."
subject100,0," - the hidden antiquity sites (only available after filling the tree) are different from normal antiquity sites in that once you excavate them, there is a chance (i've seen 30%) that instead of the 2 normal decisions to make (create a landmark or create an ancient artifact), you can also unearth a great work of writing. you can decide to either add the great work of writing to your museum, wonder, etc., or you can use it for the cultural boost (same as the one you get when you expend a great writer). so if you get 2-3 hidden antiquity sites that provide this option, you can earn yourself quite a bit of culture and get yourself a few extra policies (especially if you time the discovery to coincide with a golden age or the worlds fair victory bonus period)."
subject100,0," - i've liked the quests and decisions from civ:be. i think the mechanic should be scaled back, and a bit more thoughtful than ""make a decision the first time you build every building."" but i enjoy that each game felt a little different, and that you could use decisions to boost areas you were weak in due to starting location, neighbors, etc. i'd also like world events, like: -a plague that reduces city populations and spreads from trade/other contact; -an earthquake damages a continent and changes certain tiles; -new luxury resources appear in later eras (making previously worthless territories worthwhile settling spots). it would make the games that you roleplay on lower difficulties more interesting, and if it had an on/off option like ancient ruins or raging barbarians, it wouldn't ruin deity games or mp."
subject100,0," - in addition to the ones already mentioned: * vote to ban their primary luxury in world congress (might have some unintended consequences) * vote to embargo that civ. * if they have cities connected by roads, and those roads are outside their territory, you can raze the roads and break city connections. * gift strategic resources/units to anyone fighting that civ (this can be especially effective for city states fighting a civ). * if helpful, grant open borders to anyone fighting that civ. it can provide nice flanking opportunities if the enemy civ borders you. * steal their city state allies."
subject100,0," - seconding venice. and assuming you fill out some of commerce as venice, you will spend the entire second half of the game buying very cheap buildings and units, and only hard-building wonders."
subject100,0," - (a bit long for eli5, so apologies) each citizen needs 2 food to survive. if you have food yields (from buildings, working food tiles, or trade routes) greater than (2)(population), the extra food gets added to your food basket each turn. once this basket is filled, you get an extra citizen! this citizen can now work a new tile, giving you more food/production/gold, and the cycle continues. after each population growth, the food basket is empty and also gets a little bit bigger, which is why your cities grow much faster when small, and much slower when large. this also explains why some policies/buildings improve +growth, +excess food, or +food leftover (these are all different concepts). your production is directly tied to your citizens (who work production tiles or act as specialists) and your buildings. if you have 1 citizen, and he works a mine for 3 production, each turn you can produce 3 hammers. if a building costs 30 hammers, it will take 10 turns. if your population grows to 2, and now you can work 2 mines, you produce 6 hammers per turn, and your building is now built in 5 turns. as you can easily see, the more citizens you have to provide production (either by working tiles or as specialists), the greater your production each turn is, and the faster you can build buildings. the actual formulas vary greatly based on the tiles you can work, the improvements your workers make, and the buildings in the city. an easy way to understand this mechanic is, when your city first grows to population 2, open up your city management screen (by clicking on the city). then click citizen management in the upper right corner, and move your citizen around to different tiles. you will see direct changes to however long the building in your production queue has left, and you will see changes to 'turns to next citizen.' now take what you know for how 1 citizen moved around changes this, and multiply it by your entire populace for later in the game. each game has a trade-off decision you have to make. typically 'production-focused' tiles like mines will help you build early buildings much faster, but your cities will grow slower (and thus you have fewer citizens to work tiles). alternatively, you can work farms to grow your city quickly, but your buildings will take much longer to build (until you have enough citizens to work production tiles in addition to food tiles). since population drives several other key resources (like gold from trade routes and science), you generally want to do everything possible to get your cities as large as your happiness allows. typically your production keeps up as your cities grow (assuming you settled near a few hills or forests), but you may want to manually adjust your citizens every so often to make sure your production isn't too low. alternatively, if your cities aren't growing (and you want them to), you may need to re-assign citizens to food tiles at the expense of production."
subject100,0, - vanilla france. rolled to a culture victory without really understanding mechanics because france's vanilla ua was so strong.
subject100,0," - hard to know what you haven't tried, but a few of my favorite games: venice on archipelago. venice is probably my favorite civ, and you can really dominate with a strong navy (which venice can afford). polynesia on terra. take your first settler, and swim across the ocean (might take a few re-rolls until you head in the correct direction initially) to the americas and settler the pristine continent. turn on raging barbs for a fun challenge when you land. songhai on tilted axis. you end up with many more barbarian spawns (since the tundra is typically not settled until much later), so you can have a 3-4 unit brute squad patrolling the arctic, clearing barbarian camps to fund your empire."
subject100,0," - do you have a strong coastal city? if so, you can easily build up a navy that can beat rome, because the ai is bad at naval warfare. 4-5 frigates can easily clear the ocean of enemies (including pillaging work boats and trade routes). if you start with a few promotions (thanks to a few +xp buildings), you can easily get the +range and +heal outside friendly territory promotions. then it is just a matter of capturing a few coastal cities on the roman continent. you can either liberate these cities to make friends, or keep 1 or 2 as a new base for your army. i personally struggle to keep lots of cs allies (especially on epic speed), and i'm guessing you didn't open piety, making it even harder. you can definitely turtle and win a science victory, but i think it would be more fun to play as liberator against those roman tyrants."
subject100,0," - disagree that internal always beats external. sometimes i'm up against the happiness cap, so greatly increasing population isn't helpful. and let's not pretend that gold has no value. you need gold to upgrade units and rush-buy units and buildings. and international trade routes can be a nice boost to science, depending on your neighbors' tech level. i agree that, especially early on, that internal routes are more ""bang for your buck"" (e.g., 4 food is more scarce than 3-4 gold), but that doesn't mean it is necessarily the best choice."
subject100,0," - it has to do with the order of operations when you end your turn. if you set your citizen management to 'production focus,' and lock the hex tiles, you end up with an extra turn of production every time you gain a new citizen. it is a key optimization move on higher difficulties. just remember to remember to unlock tiles once you make improvements and develop tech. or at least revisit periodically to make sure the tiles you locked are still optimal tiles to work. also, i recommend not automating workers. they can often do silly things like chopping jungles (which you might want for science later) or building roads in non-optimal lines."
subject100,0," - again, i don't think its clear-cut. the production value is definitely higher vs. the gold, but (a) the gold provides flexibility - i don't know if i will want a building or a unit upgrade, and (b) at least initially, you are only sending production out of the capital (until satellite cities have workshops). i usually rush-buy buildings in my capital, so that i can build wonders, guilds, settlers, etc. the extra production in satellites is certainly helpful, but i'd rather build wonders and rush-buy in my capital. lastly, its very important (since losing science spirals quickly) not to get into negative gold (not negative gpt, but a negative treasury), and in some games i can only stay ahead with external trade routes."
subject100,0," - previous comments about honor as sub-optimal are correct. however, there are some times where it can be useful/fun. for instance, playing as either the aztecs (for the extra culture), songhai (to quickly clear camps for gold) or germany (to quickly build a cheap army) can make honor a little bit more palatable, especially the opener which will notify you of camp spawns. further, opening honor can be quite a bit of fun on lower difficulties, because you end up creating a strong early army that has a couple of promotions, making it easier to capture an enemy capital or two. but again, if you are just beginning, i wouldn't recommend honor as a beginner until you get more proficient at the rest of the game."
subject100,0,"civ revolutions 2 - any good on a phone's screen? - does anyone have experience with civ revolutions 2 for an android phone? i love the civ series and am getting tired of my usual games on my phone for conference calls and subway rides. note that i'd be on a phone, not a tablet, if that matters. other turn-based single-player or 4x type phone game suggestions also welcome."
subject100,0," - its a way of avoiding doing work. but honestly, my favorite part of those threads is that there is often a mod already created that does what you wish the base game contained. and by posting your idea, people will mention the mod, and your civ experience is improved."
subject100,0," - any hints about map type? if you are playing an islands or small continents map, i'd go liberty for the early production and because you might want to expand to more fertile lands (wheat tiles notwithstanding)."
subject100,0," - there are times when it is okay to automate a few workers. for instance, once you discover railroads, it can be frustrating to manually improve each road tile. however, the ai has a bad habit of 1. not improving the best tiles first (like those luxury resources you just discovered the tech for) and 2. improving tiles that you can't work yet (like improving 10 tiles around a 4 population city, while your 8 population capital only has 3 improved tiles)."
subject100,0," - in addition to the tradition social policy, the key to having a strong army without paying an arm and a leg is to become very adept at using ranged units well. you can survive with 1-2 melee units and 3-4 era-appropriate ranged units against 5x that number of enemy units. the key is to use terrain to your advantage, encourage enemy units to smash into your melee units or city walls, and keep your ranged units alive long enough to beeline the key promotions (logistics and range). your army won't be 'formidable' in the sense that ai fears you, but it will be formidable in the sense that 4-5 pre-gatling gun ranged units and a few melee meatshields can conquer the world."
subject100,0," - i am cautiously optimistic. i liked be when it launched, it just didn't have the same replayability for me that civ v has. i probably played 3-4 games of be (vs 1000+ hours of civ v) and felt like i had done everything i wanted to. i would be very interested in an article/post that is like the old 'wow patch changes,' that lists all the new features and all the changes/updates to current content. i would also be more interested if rising tide was $20 instead of whatever it is."
subject100,0," - venice and germany: double trade routes, and each trade route to a city state grants 5% production."
subject100,0," - i think this could be a ton of fun if done well. it would be difficult to do well though, given how so much of the game's progression is time-based. one way you could overcome this would be by having each mission limited to different eras. so you still need to perform research, but you are only researching up to a certain point. you could also have missions that have economic or other non-military goals. i'm not sure if firaxis would ever implement this (though it seems moddable), but your description of xp-point earning great general has me hankering for figuring out how to install warcraft iii on my 2010 mac laptop (which surprisingly plays civ v well)."
subject100,0," - farm xp off each other. others see that you are always at war, but in reality, you are just creating cover ii, medic, march, blitz warriors by bombarding them with range, logistics, siege archers for each other."
subject100,0," - i'm doing something similar in a marathon game with the aztecs. i'm finding a few things are crucial: you have to raze all non-capitals you capture. it is painful to have wide gaps in your territory, but with 22 ais, there just won't be enough luxury resource diversity to justify keeping non-capital cities. i don't keep all cities permanently puppeted. i let the puppeted city build 5 or 6 key buildings, then once the population is high enough and production is decent, i'll annex the city. this allows you to quickly build or rush-buy a courthouse and a few basic happiness buildings. if you are liberty, devote several workers to be your road-building chain gang. the city connections are nice happiness boosts, and you get the added benefit of quickly reinforcing your army. for ideology (i'm not there yet), i will likely go with autocracy. lots of +happiness to various relatively low-hammer buildings. you won't need all those barracks, etc., but just build them for the happiness."
subject100,0, - also depends on game speed. 1 or 2 extra turns on epic or marathon won't set you as far back as wasting a turn on quick.
subject100,0," - if you are not going for a cultural victory, the theming bonus is more akin to optimization. if you are going for a cultural victory, getting your theming bonuses is an important aspect of strategy. either way, its a good idea to work towards bonuses, though, since it does not take too much effort. just a note: there is a difference between 'art' and 'artifacts,' even though both have the same 'paint palette' icon. i spent many a frustrating game wondering why i wasn't getting theming bonuses from combining a painting and beads from the same era and same civilization."
subject100,0, - iroquois are also pretty bad
subject100,0," - going to, not gonna. :)"
subject100,0," - normal is a lot less 'busy' if you turn down your graphics options. i usually play huge maps on an old mac laptop, so i need to do everything i can to improve cpu performance. with the visual settings all turned to low, i find that 'normal' view almost becomes a 'strategic+' view, giving me the best of both worlds."
subject100,0," - to emphasize this point: build range units and keep at least a few of them alive. if you have 2-3 archers/comp bowmen survive your early wars, you now have near-unkillable units that can be the focal point of your next invasion. 2-3 range/logistics comp bowmen surrounded by melee units and a horseman for line of sight can handle almost any war at those difficulty levels (assuming ai hasn't completely out-teched you). if you do the same thing with a trebuchet, once you research cannons/artillery, you'll have a siege unit that can't be reached by city defenses, and again, you can keep your invasion force moving along."
subject100,0, - it can be fun playing the non-spherical maps with a military focus. shaka on great plains means that you can march an army all across the map without needing to deal with a navy.
subject100,0," - if he has a huge continent, he likely has 90% of his forces arrayed near where you have your navy. not sure what the rest of your military looks like, but maybe send some troops around to the other side of his continent and take a shot at one of his other cities? i see 2 possibilities: 1. he overreacts and sends needed ground troops and planes to reinforce, which means your main attack force can now do some damage, or 2. you catch him with his pants down, steal an easy city, and now have a base of operations for a land war. one other fun option (might not be possible due to your gpt). build a settler, and sneak him over to the edges of rome's borders. plop down a city, rush-buy an airport, and reinforce. rome will start streaming units to kick you out, and if you send 5-6 bombers to rebase in the new city, and have plenty of machine guns and aa around, you'll get to grind down his units without dealing with 1. his city defenses and 2. the units in the fog of war surrounding his city. with the airport, you can use your 'real' cities to church out troops that can now fly over with 2 turns of movement, meaning you can take some losses (which is less true for a navy, generally)."
subject100,0," - not only is there no point to improving the non-luxury/strategic tiles, there is a real downside. improved tiles can be pillaged, meaning you are giving every other civ that invades you more tiles to heal on and earn gold from."
subject100,0," - general idea. you want to focus your research on (a) getting more science, which improves all of your research, and (b) researching the technologies that align with your goals. for point (a), there is generally one tech in each era that unlocks new science buildings or wonders, and it is usually a good idea to prioritize those techs. for point (b), if you are aiming for a cultural victory, you obviously want to research the techs that unlock cultural buildings/wonders first, all other things considered; if you are aiming for an early domination victory, you want to get composite bowmen quickly. on higher levels, you are correct about petra. you would need to ignore almost everything else except needed luxury techs. this is really only true on difficulty 6 or above. it is true that your researching a tech reduces the tech cost for others, but it does not reduce the tech cost for you for other tiers. sometimes it seems that way, if you leave some techs unresearched, but really what is happening is that you are just producing more science. that being said, if there is a tech tree you don't need (like many of the early sailing techs because you are landlocked), its not a bad idea to leave the tree unresearched, then steal those techs from ais with your spy (or quickly research them when they are down to 1 or 2-turns to research). similarly, if you don't plan on going to war much, you can prioritize the growth/cultural/science techs for a particular era, then go back and get the military techs. my general rule of thumb is that i want to have all of the techs of the previous era. so if i am in the classical era, i won't beeline any techs in the medieval era without also getting the ancient era techs. now sometimes the game dictates something else (like your petra example), but i generally play on immortal and this strategy usually works. the general science mechanics are: each citizen provides 1 science. each city creates a pool of science points, and each tech costs a certain number of science points (reflected in 'turns to research'). so if you increase your population, you are increasing the number of science points produced by that city. that science is further modified by policies and buildings (eg, libraries provide for +1 per 2citizens, or observatories for +50%). these mechanics are why 'science-turtle' victories are so popular and effective. if you beeline buildings that increase your growth and boost your science, you can very quickly get a lead in technology. if you build a library and an observatory, a 10 pop city goes from producing 10 science to 22.5 science. and every time that city grows by 1 pop, your science actually goes up 2.25. factor in more science buildings and the rationalism tree, you can see how you can easily produce hundreds or thousands of science points per turn. i don't have a good list of techs that should be avoided (though ironworking is a good example of a tech most people hate). but but just consider, each time you need to pick a tech, ""will i really use what this tech unlocks."" if you have 3-4 buildings in your queue for each city, do you really need to unlock harbors? if you are not at war, do you really need to be able to upgrade your comp bowmen to crossbows? if you balance this line of thought with ""what are my overall victory condition goals,"" and ""where am i weak right now (eg, economy/low gpt, low on happiness),"" you should be able to generally pick the techs that will keep your empire growing."
subject100,0," - i don't have a specific number in mind when i assign specialists, but i like to ensure that (a) i'm working enough non-science buildings/tiles to ensure decent growth (i don't want it to take 80 turns to earn another citizen) and (b) i am working all the 'good' tiles in a city radius (like improved luxuries, farms on a river, improved fish) where i'm getting 5-6 'resources' from working the tile. at the point i'm working desert farms or unimproved jungle pre-universities, i might work 1-2 science buildings. i'm probably on the low end of specialist use though (until i get to ideologies and freedom tenets), because i'd rather forego a bit of science and great scientist points mid-game if it means that i have a 40+ pop city late-game."
subject100,0," - yes. i play civ v on a mac, and i can use all of the mods on the steam workshop (can't link because i'm at work). on the steam workshop, if you subscribe for a mod, it should be available once you run your civ v client. for me, i used to have like 5 options on the opening civ v screen (single player, multiplayer, options, credits, exit). once you subscribe for a mod, there will be a mods button to click."
subject100,0," - i raze any non-capital city (with some exception - see below), and then puppet every capital city for at least the duration of the unrest period. then, when unrest ends and i have sufficient cash, i will annex the city, and rush-buy a courthouse and any cheap happiness buildings (like a circus). i sometimes keep non-capital cities (with the same strategy above) if the city has something very important, like a natural wonder or several unique luxuries, but i find this to be rare. and even then, sometimes it is better for your happiness to raze the city anyways, and then re-settle with your settler. this is especially true in non-capital cities because the ai usually settles in sub-optimal spots. you will still get the warmonger penalty (and have civs hate you for a long time) even if the enemy was the aggressor, you were completely justified, etc. etc. these suggestions are for pre-ideology domination rushes. once you hit ideologies, happiness really shouldn't be an issue if you pick the +happiness tenets."
subject100,0," - if you typically play venice/babylon, i assume you like to play (or are more comfortable playing) tall/tradition. you can still play this way as rome, you just need to reconsider how your cities work. typically in tall/tradition, your capital is your powerhouse and factory, and you spend most of the game having your satellite cities play catch-up, host guilds, etc.. with rome, your capital will still be strong, but your satellite cities will be more helpful for producing units, caravans, settlers, etc., due to the ua. the ua generally results in satellite cities completing buildings much faster, so they have more idle time, so they can spend time contributing military and trade units for your empire. this means you might build barracks in all your cities where previously you only had a barracks in your capital. the flip side is that you will have much tougher decisions to make in your capital. you may need to forego some mid-tier wonders and instead focus on building non-wonder buildings, because getting the buildings done has such a large benefit for your satellite cities. if you want to play wide/liberty, then you can just use typical wide strategies and rome will do very well. the only minor difference is that i try to focus a bit more on gold when i play rome, so that i can rush-buy buildings while i'm hard-building settlers in my capital, so that i don't fall too far behind on my building queue. rome's uus have nice synergy (ballista and legion), so depending on the map, it might be nice to steal a capital during the classical era."
subject100,0," - the maps show up in advanced setup when i'm choosing my civ, opponents, etc. for me, it is just another map to choose."
subject100,0," - agreed. if i need variety in my civ games, i can play random ai opponents or download modded civs. i do wish there was a way to just disable the player's civ's start bias (and not everyone's), because that could make for some fun challenges."
subject100,0," - i raze non-capitals unless there is something very appealing about a particular city (e.g., good natural wonder, has +happiness world wonders, has luxury resources no other city can provide), or has important strategic value (e.g., gives me a toehold in a new continent, provides an important tactical advantage). but both of these instances are rare. when i capture a capital, i leave it as a puppet until the unrest period ends. then i rush-buy a courthouse and any other cheap +happiness buildings. i agree that it is odd when you have large swathes of unclaimed territory, but if you also have an army of road-building workers, you can bridge some of that gap with an efficient road system. further ways to help with happiness include getting a religion with +happiness buildings (mosques or pagodas are most popular), so that you can use your faith to keep your happiness levels decent."
subject100,0," - it is definitely hurting you in the long run. many end-game metrics (science and culture, for instance) are severely hindered with only 2-3 cities. you have to play very optimally if you want to go down this path; otherwise your research progress stagnates in later eras, and you are susceptible to tourism from larger civs (not to mention the military risk). i had this problem frequently when i first started playing. i'd see an ancient/classical wonder and think, ""wow, that's way more fun than a settler."" or maybe, ""my empire would be doing so much better if i hurried up and had a market in each city."" the reality though, is that getting an extra city or two set up and growing adds so much more to your empire than any one building can. i recommend playing a game where, no matter what, win or lose, you force yourself to build 4 cities by the time you have researched the national college. there are some units/buildings you 'need' to build, like a scout, and some units for defense. but otherwise focus on getting settlers out early, and accept that you'll need to play catch-up for the first 100 turns or so."
subject100,0," - for games like you describe, getting a religion with either 2 religious buildings (mosques, pagodas) or +happiness boosts (i think there is one for settling cities on a river - which is a good idea anyways) can go a long way. you may also want to more carefully control your city focus (i.e., select 'avoid growth') until you can improve luxuries in the area."
subject100,0," - the main benefit i find for taking someone else's religion is not spending gold (on building upkeep), hammers (on building production), or faith (to be used for gs/ge purchases later) on setting up and maintaining my own religion. i don't think there is some secret ""trick"" to letting the ai convert your cities other than what you mention in your post, though."
subject100,0," - in 3v3, i think venice gains relevance as an actual mp option. venice feeds (with gold/science) his allies through double trade routes and can focus on wonders, while his allies generally protect him with a bit of military help. the dutch ua is also nice, as the dutch player can just go wide to snag as many luxuries as possible, then trade them to allies for 50% more team happiness. in terms of good civ combos, england/korea is a fun combo, as sotl and turtle ships can let you conquer the coastal world during the renaissance. if playing pangea, england/china leads to longbow/chokuno combos that becomes tough to counter. again, both come online during medieval, so they can work well in tandem. aztecs and mongols for an early rush, as jaguars provide cover/escort for battering rams."
subject100,0," - i also think you mixed up ' gt;' with ' lt;,' unless you have 11 words to describe china. remember, the little number eats up the big number!"
subject100,0," - other option if you aren't rushing a specific victory: be indecisive and just grab the openers (and maybe +1 policy) from most of the trees. on naval maps, the explo opener is always nice. the commerce and aesthetics openers are always good. patronage isn't bad if you have 1-2 city states you plan on allying with all game. you won't dominate any one facet, but you'll be a little bit better in a few different areas. i'd skip honor, since usually barbs aren't an issue by the time you have a tree filled."
subject100,0," - always manage. its just not that much effort to handle workers manually, and the ai is just so bad when left alone."
subject100,0," - sometimes ais can be convinced to offer peace if you take the war to their homeland. while i agree sometimes taking cities isn't worth it, you can still do quite a bit of damage with a few fast-moving troops protected by a few naval units. 2-3 knights with a frigate backing them up can likely let you run amok over an ai's territory, pillaging units, capturing (then deleting for gold) workers, and plundering trade routes. sometimes this prompts the ai to offer a neutral peace deal, and even if peace isn't offered, it cripples that ai's war machine, so you have to spend less effort on defense."
subject100,0," - i find battering rams to be slightly better for a few reasons: 1. rams are earlier in the tech tree, and come from a tech that isn't outside the normal tech progression (not that siege towers are). 2. you can get a ram from an ancient ruin unit upgrade. 3. the ram is slightly stronger (unless you have 2 siege towers adjacent or 2 hexes away). i think both are very good, though, and make early warmongering considerably more fun."
subject100,0," - i play almost exclusively on marathon. it takes several play sessions to get through a game, but i like an 'epic-ness' feel to my games (other similar games: i conquer the entire world in rometw and medieval tw, or i build massive cities in simcity that fill the map). i play every game to completion, so its fun and worth to me it in the end. i couple marathon with playing on huge maps with additional civs, so you have lots of exploring and diplo work in the early game while you are waiting to build up your infrastructure, and when end-game rolls around, you and the ai have large enough empires to have some massive wars. the downside is that many popular reddit/civfanatics strategies don't work quite the same (you really need to tinker with build order when your settler takes 30 turns), and getting caught unawares (either in war or economically) can really set you back. a random backstab is much tougher to rebound from when you need 50 turns to make 3 ranged and a melee."
subject100,0," - similar to jurrepur's comment about settling: you probably should have tried settling near guangzhou before guangzhou was settled as your second city, giving you access to the spices (and possibly wine with a citadel). i'm not sure if that was possible during this game, but if i know that i have a sealed-off peninsula (where you have daegu and that other city name in the north i can't read), i like to first settle possibly contested land. you have all the time in the world to settle the northern peninsula if you don't grant open borders, because ai probably can't reach it (and it isn't great land to begin with). therefore, make contested areas a priority for early settlers, then fill in uncontested space later if you want to."
subject100,0," - seems like it worsens diplomacy, because now you have one less tool for making deals. its also terribly un-historic, since there was nothing like this in the classical era. even prior to 1950/1960, we didn't have anything close to international marketplaces. other basic exploits: your enemy using bombers and you are using infantry? build a bunch of unused oil-consuming units, which drives up your enemy's gpt and cuts his military effectiveness. doesn't feel realistic. honestly, it seems like you're creating a complex system to solve a basic problem (ai not properly valuing trading away luxury resources). why not just revise ai code to better understand when an ai has enough excess happiness to justify trading away the last of a luxury resource?"
subject100,0," - tall = a few cities (3 or 4 cities) that have many citizens. going 'tall' usually means taking tradition as your first social policy, because tradition (a) provides bonuses for a strong capital (culture, growth, happiness) and (b) grants growth and culture bonuses to up to 4 cities (free monument and aqueduct). wide = many cities (at least 5 or 6 cities) that have smaller populations (at least at first). going 'wide' usually means taking liberty as your first social policy, because liberty (a) has bonuses independent of the number of cities (like the city connection bonus and the opener of +1 culture in all cities) and (b) has bonuses to settlers and workers, which you will need more of if you have more cities."
subject100,0," - not saying international trade didn't exist, but it certainly didn't exist in the manner you are describing: near infinite access to all resources from all over the world. at least now you need to have met a civ. as for complexity, yes it would be under the hood, but that doesn't mean a system isn't complex. developers need to balance all of these numbers for every kind of map/game/speed and each type of victory condition. you're throwing out these gold% multipliers and gpt amounts, but these numbers need to fit in the context of all the other resources of the game. otherwise contributions to this 'pool' completely negate all other means of gold acquisition, or alternatively, completely negate necessary growth-limiting factors like army size or building maintenance, and the whole game becomes ""settle as many cities as possible near resources."" so someone needs to run all the numbers for various scenarios to make sure things work. not a simple request, when you consider that we can't get firaxis to program move+shoot ranged ai units. again, i don't see what this idea solves. you describe trade as tedious (nicely done), but i don't think this is a common complaint among the community. its a screen that maybe comes up once every couple of turns, and frankly the requests for open borders/dofs are 10x more annoying and more frequent."
subject100,0," - agree to disagree, i guess. i don't buy your ""wizards"" complaint in a game where my civ has travelled to another civ (or vice versa), we have diplomatic relations, and i can find them on a map. if anything, i think your scenario requires more wizards to store all of these resources in a vault in the ether in 1000 bc so that people can take what they need. i don't find the need to trade my 10 horses (never had 50 iron, seems high) in the information era for 10 gpt when i have 200+ gpt, because it feels like an exploit (like stealing an early worker from city-states). i suppose i'm not min-maxing perfectly, but its also not necessary for a functioning economy if you are doing things right. does it suck that you have unused horses and iron? a little, i guess, but it also seems silly to get some sort of reward for them well after they become obsolete."
subject100,0," - world congress makes sense to me. i agree that the purchase/sale of luxuries gets frustrating if you want to warmonger (you are basically shut out of world trade), but again, i'd much rather see firaxis fix this one issue. it doesn't seem like we need a whole new mechanic, but rather just need to toggle how the ais value luxuries with respect to happiness and gpt. and really, i think this discussion gets to the root of the problem: that luxuries can be a very frustrating mechanic early and mid-game, as the primary source of happiness, and therefore growth. for all of beyond earth's flaws, i found the health system to be a bit more enjoyable to manage."
subject100,0," - my luxuries get around same way i communicate with civs when i want to declare war, or enter into a research agreement. just because there's no ""diplomat"" unit walking from one capital to another doesn't mean it isn't happening. it happens the same way i tell satellite cities what to produce or research. or tell distant armies where to go. on some level, you have to accept that there is some omniscience/omnipresence in these games. it wouldn't be much fun if, instead of making decisions, you sent out 20 messengers to effect decisions each turn and had to hope they made it to their destinations, and then brought back details for you. more realistic. yes. more difficult. yes. more fun? not for me. i get what you're saying about making luxuries and trade more interesting, and i think its a good avenue to explore for civ 6. i just don't think the concept of a global pool (at least before 1900s level technology) is the way to do it. and i'd be wary of tying player success even more tightly to keeping trade routes alive (unless we also develop a better system for managing/initiating trade routes)."
subject100,0," - be has some other major issues, but i've heard good things about the rising tide expansion. i enjoyed playing 5-6 games of be, but i didn't find it had the replay-ability of civ v. i'd wait until both be and rt are on sale in a bundle."
subject100,0," - i like honor with the aztecs and jaguars. if you keep your starting jaguar (and build 2-3 more) alive, you can have success while not falling too far behind on culture."
subject100,0," - i recently ran a similar game as the aztecs. i opened honor and went a bit more melee-heavy than usual to maximize the value of the jaguars. jaguars with a few cover and medic promotions were basically unkillable, and by pillaging tiles and strategically killing defending units, my units easily stayed at high health. then 2-3 ranged units could burn down city defenses unmolested. for games like these, i prefer a civ with an early effective uu (like the huns, assyria or the aztecs). i like to wipe out all the civs that start on my continent before we meet any other continents, to avoid dealing with major warmonger penalties throughout the late game. you can play any science civ (korea, babylon) and just get a huge tech lead, then smash the whole globe once you have rocket artillery, but that can be a bit of a slog on a huge map. you end up massacring your opponents (which is fun), but it can take a few hours of clicking when victory is basically guaranteed."
subject100,0," - if you want to go to war, i recommend playing continents or large islands. the warmonger penalties only apply to civs you have met. if you wipe out a few civs early on before you meet the rest of the world, no penalties! so you can play an early domination game, but then once you research astronomy, you can play nice with the rest of the world (albeit as the owner of your own continent and several powerhouse cities). and to echo marcvshr, with a bowl and parks and rec re-runs on in the background."
subject100,0," - the ai settles cities in a lot of bad spots. it doesn't hinder the ai too much, because they have certain growth and happiness (among other) bonuses at higher difficulties. but a city that the ai can grow to 20 pop, a human player on immortal might only get to 10-15 pop without outside help. there is also the happiness issue. most non-capital cities you capture will result in a net reduction in happiness. its rarely worth it to annex or puppet a mediocre city if it bring you below 10 unhappiness (due to loss of science, rebellions, etc.). and sometimes the ai was just being a dick, and you need the satisfaction of burning down everything he ever loved, and then salting the ground around the ruins of his cities."
subject100,0, - how do you stop the ai from building it right at turn 1? you'd have an amazingly easy start if every ai was trying to build the wonder (and let their empires stagnate). i don't know how the ai prioritizes wonder building.
subject100,0," - its a wonder that makes typically very weak tiles (deserts) considerably stronger. if you select desert folklore (+1 faith from desert tiles) and also get petra, you are able to build a very powerful city on land that would otherwise be close to worthless."
subject100,0," - i think you are thinking of 'pita,' not 'pits.'"
subject100,0," - researching radio puts your civ in the modern era, which allows you to choose an ideology. as you probably know, the first (and second) to get an ideology get free tenets. the other alternative to ideologies is to research industrialization, then build 3 factories. the downside to industrialization is 1. sometimes you don't have coal in your empire (especially if you went 4 city tradition) and 2. factories take time to build and are expensive to rush-buy, giving another ai the chance to beat you to first ideology. the other consideration is that radio, in addition to giving you an ideology, unlocks plastics (which lets you build research labs). therefore, you get the double benefit of getting closer to more science."
subject100,0, - thought my invasion force of great war infantry and machine guns would easily wipe out a civ protected by mostly aa guns. who designed aa guns to be such melee juggernauts?!
subject100,0," - rome: total war (1 definitely, not sure about 2) and medieval: total war ii are both what you describe. you decide the buildings in your cities, your tax rates, your growth rates, etc., giving you the general 'civ' feel of managing the growth of an empire and diplomatic relations. you also create armies (so, for example, your might army might have 2 archer companies, 4 spearman companies, and 1 cavalry company), and when you go into battle, you have the chance to manually control each company (send them to battlefield locations, tell them to walk/run, tell them to use flaming arrows vs. regular arrows). each company is made up of 50-100 men, so in this scenario, you'd have 7 different units to control in real-time, and there are real-time changes over the battle (units get tired if you run them too much, units rout if they start to get overwhelmed). i personally love both games and have put several hundred hours into each. there is a ton of replayability because, like civ, you can play different countries/factions that have their unique bonuses and buildings. both games are a bit older, so i recommend trying out the newer games in the 'total war' series if you big into graphics."
subject100,0," - india is often overlooked for a wide empire. india struggles when you initially form a city, but once that city has more than 6 pop, it produces less unhappiness than another civ's city. so if you use internal trade routes to quick boost up newly settled cities, you can overcome some of the happiness issues that plague mid- and late-game wide empires. the downside is that it is hard to spam settlers early on."
subject100,0," - i generally work food and production tiles to keep my ""turns until next citizen"" low enough to ensure consistent growth. after that, i'll work specialist slots in the following order: science buildings, then either production buildings or guilds (depending on my culture). i generally won't work gold buildings. i usually just set my citizen management to ""food focus,"" but i frequently check all of my cities and lock citizens to work the very good tiles. unfortunately ""food focus"" (or any ""-focus"") can result in wonky ai decisions (like not working an academy planted on a hill, or whatever), even though that tile is worth a lot of resources, so the best strategy is to constantly check up on what tiles are being used."
subject100,0," - on your cultural screen, you will se all of your buildings that house great works. each building that can hold multiple great works has a theming bonus. if you mouse over the empty great works slot, you can see what is needed to achieve the theming bonus. for example, a museum gives you +2 tourism if you fill both slots with art or artifact from the same civilization and the same era. so if you have a babylonian painting from the ancient era, and french painting from the modern era, you would want to try to trade one or both of these pieces of art with the ai that would fulfill the theming requirement. who/when varies based on what great works are available for trade in the swap great works sub-screen, but the general idea is that you want your theming bonuses active for as long as possible, so if you have an unused bonus, frequently check the swap screen until a worthwhile trade comes up. a note on theming bonuses, 'art' and 'artifacts' are 2 different things, and typically you need one or the other for a bonus. so if you have beads and starry night (a painting), you won't active theming bonuses. typically you get artifacts from archeology digs, and archeology can be a great way to quickly fill up your museums with artifacts that will give you theming bonuses. another note: in multiplayer, no one ever swaps great works, so this isn't a valid mp strategy."
subject100,0," - caravans are a unit (like a worker, warrior or settler) that you have to build in your city or purchase. you can build your first one once you research animal husbandry, and you can build additional caravans once you research certain techs or build certain wonders. there is an icon at the top of your screen that tells you how many trade routes you have in operations, and how many you can have in total. note that using either a caravan or a cargo ship occupies a trade route."
subject100,0," - in addition to other comments, consider terrain. you may not be able to readily attack your target from all available tiles (either due to hills, forests, mountains or rivers). in a scenario where you can only get 2-3 ranged units in place, you will need a few more melee units, because they will need to sop up more damage due to the longer siege time. i don't have a good equation of 'x city strength = y ranged units to capture,' but it is something you'll get a feel for after a few invasions."
subject100,0," - vanilla france is a good civ for going wide, due to their +2 culture per city. one of the limiting factors of going wide is that social policies get too expensive; france's vanilla ua helps overcome this issue."
subject100,0," - it also reduces the fog of war around your city, reducing the chance of barbarian camps spawning near you. lastly, there are several policies, religious tenets, building benefits, etc. that affect your units ""in friendly territory"" or ""in your territory."" obviously these benefits are greater the more territory you have."
subject100,0," - agreed. sometimes ""x is plotting against you"" may only mean that x is trying to steal your technologies, or x is encouraging other civs to hate you. its too bad, because when i see that someone is plotting against me, i start to itch for a war, and 9 times out of 10 its just a tease."
subject100,0," - how do you spawn great directors? how do you manage theming bonuses, since its likely most great plays will be in the same era? i just don't see what this adds to gameplay, other than forcing further min-maxing of great works to include film. i think it makes more sense to just add some modern directors to the pool of individuals who can be great artists, and lump their plays/movies into great art works."
subject100,0," - my question about theming bonuses was more tilted to the issue that it seems like these great works only start spawning very late in the game. so it you can only get these works in the modern and info eras, for example, it becomes too easy to achieve your theming bonuses (vs. art, writing and music which can start getting produced in the renaissance)."
subject100,0," - i love an angry ai who wants war from the get-go. you usually end up with 3-4 logistics/range archers, which can be the backbone of an army that can do some serious damage with early warmongering. you might fall behind a bit in science, and lose a worker or two, but if you keep your units alive, i find its pretty easy to eventually turn the tables in war and pick up a few choice cities."
subject100,0,"advice for upgrading - my wife and i have shared a macbook since 2010, and it is on its last legs. i'm hoping someone could offer up recommendations for a new macbook (or air, or pro). some background: portability isn't an issue, which i assume is the major draw of the macbook air? similarly, as adults, we can manage keeping our laptop charged, so battery life isn't a big appeal. we aren't big graphics people. we mostly use the computer for personal use: email, internet, and some light gaming (by me). we also have a roku for our streaming-tv needs. i haven't read much about the 'retina' displays, so i'd appreciate some input on how to value them. while price is always a concern, i'm more inclined to buy a better machine now, since i've averaged about 4-5 years per laptop. i'd rather spend more now so that the laptop runs better in a few years. it seems like one distinguishing option on many of the macbooks available is a larger traditional hd vs. a smaller solid-state hd. we are accumulating lots of photos/videos of our new baby, but i don't know how likely we are to fill up any of the hds. apologies if this thread is asked almost weekly. i wasn't having much luck with the search feature (probably due to acronym ignorance)."
subject100,0, - thanks!
subject100,0, - thanks. i'll look into an external harddrive too!
subject100,0," - there is a mod referenced in this thread that lets you extend the length of each era. i haven't used it, but presumably you could make the post-ren eras infinitely long? or at least extend the eras you enjoy to be much longer. https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/3kx5uv/what_speed_do_you_play_on_do_you_use_a_modded/ there is also a recently released enlightenment era mod which adds more units and techs right after the ren era. and while its not quite what you are looking for, the games rome:total war and medieval:total war ii are similar to civ and are focused on the eras you mention. you build an empire and fight wars (there is no focus on technological research, sadly) entirely within the ancient (e.g., hoplites, cavalry and ballista) or medieval (e.g., knights, cannons) eras. again, its a slightly different game with a bit more focus on tactics and military success (as opposed to diplomatic or economic success), but i find it more immersive historically."
subject100,0," - i've always thought it would be cool if you could either block or tax trade routes between 2 other ais that run through your territory. you could get a minor diplo penalty or boost depending on your actions, but it wouldn't be an act of war. similarly, i'd like to see more of the spying options that beyond earth provided, where you could passively foment unrest. if another ai had happiness problems, it would be fun to have the option to 'fund rebels,' where you could pay gold or contribute military units that would pop up in the ai's territory (or on the outskirts) as a rebel faction. i know civ has problems with spawning new factions mid-game, though (i wish they could figure it out like the total war series does)."
subject100,0," - i think it could be interesting if you opted to 'defy,' you get kicked out (and therefore can't vote, participate in events like world games, or get benefits from resolutions like world ideology). maybe you need to get x number of civs to vote you back in, but since you are out, you have a diplo penalty and it makes it harder to just buy your way back in? on the other hand, what are you realistically defying other than trade embargos or non-proliferation? which means the defy mechanic might be very situational."
subject100,0," - yeah, but luxury goods, by the time world congress rolls around, probably won't be worth whatever penalties are in place. are you really going to go to war with most of the world so you can have an extra +4 happiness?"
subject100,0," - definitely a dessert, definitely technically 'normal,' definitely a disappointing option when you consider usual thanksgiving options like pumpkin or pecan pies."
subject100,0, - use them once you have enough citizens that your cities will still grow at a decent rate even while you use specialists.
subject100,0," - setting unit patrols. whether on land (scouts to prevent camps spawning in the fog of war, or to keep an eye on potential backstabbers) or on sea (for boats to track your naval trade routes), it would both be convenient and give the game some more realism."
subject100,0," - i have played and loved civ and the total war games. i'd recommend civ if you are more interested on empire building and diplomacy, with less focus on war and military tactics. i'd recommend the total war games (i'm familiar with rome i and medieval ii, neither of which you have), if you want your military tactical and army-building skills to matter more. civ's military in single-player is still fun, but the ai isn't terribly good, and ranged units are so much more powerful for the first half of the game that your military strategy is the generally the same game-to-game. the total war games give you much more flexibility with respect to army compositions, and typically different enemies will focus different army comps, so you have to be a bit more adaptable. further, you can win a civ game without going to war once; that isn't going to happen in total war. one other point of difference is that civ games span various eras (basically all of recorded history), so you are constantly gaining new technologies and your empire steadily evolves, whereas the total war games are much more static. both can be enjoyable, but some prefer one to the other."
subject100,0, - i will sometimes keep them around cities that are almost entirely plains. this is especially true if i don't need a production boost to quickly nab a wonder or crank out a settler.
subject100,0," - the general ideas for success at war is keeping your units alive, getting your units key promotions, and staying on par (or ahead) in techs with the ai. to keep your units alive: put melee units on the front line, shoot at enemies over melee units with ranged units. your melee units rarely even need to attack (and thus won't take damage from attacking), while your ranged units gring up the enemies. to keep your units promoted: focus on promotions that make earning xp easier. for ranged units, focus either +open terrain or +difficult terrain until you get 3 of these promotions, and then you unlock range and logistics. for melee units, focus on cover and medic, to keep your units alive better. to keep up in tech, the general goal is to prioritize growth (more citizens = more science), aim your tech path so that you unlock the 'science techs' first in each era, and build science buildings as soon as possible."
subject100,0," - 20s and 30s is very good happiness until you unlock ideologies. it is hard to get an empire much happier than that without sacrificing population growth. if you want even more happiness and plan to go wide though, focus on getting an early religion, and choose the religious buildings for your beliefs (pagodas, mosques, etc.)."
subject100,0," - very good advice here. generally if you aren't playing deity or immortal, and if you aren't playing with way more civs than the map supports (eg 20 civs on a small map), your settler will typically be placed in a decent enough starting area to give you a chance to win."
subject100,0," - i like playing with unlimited barbarian xp. you can build up a strong early army with all the extra promotions, which is fun. i also like the communitas map mod. it makes for some fun maps that you won't otherwise get with base civ."
subject100,0," - yes, there is an in-depth mechanic when choosing ideologies that is summarized well on this page: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/ideology_(civ5) the basic premise is that if civs that are influential over you (which you can figure out on the cultural victory tab) and have different ideologies, you will have some unhappiness."
subject100,0," - there is nothing special to futurism generally. once you select it as a tenet, every great artist, musician and writer gets you tourism points. its the same as how each turn you produce science and culture, and if you pop a great writer or scientist, you also get a lump-sum boost. there are some strategies tied to futurism where you delay building guilds, or selecting policies that grant gwams, until you select futurism. then you get as many +tourism modifiers with ais (trade routes, shared religion, etc.) and produce as many gwams and great works as possible to slingshot ahead, but it is definitely a niche strategy for winning cultural victories."
subject100,0," - each citizen produces 1 science. each citizen can then work a tile (giving you its yield) or work as a specialist in buildings with specialist slots. an unemployed citizen (ie, not assigned to a tile or a specialist spot) provides 1 production."
subject100,0," - community balance patch is basically a complete overhaul. too many changes to list. 3uc+4uc is another big one. the uc stands for 'unique component,' and it gives each civ a 3rd and 4th new unique unit/building/ability. lastly, an easy way to spice things up significantly is to add new civilizations. modded civs by jfd, among others, are popular on this sub."
subject100,0," - maybe yes in theory, but aa guns are already stupidly overpowered. no need to make them stronger."
subject100,0," - i meant that aa is also a pretty strong melee unit (at least on defense), so there's not much of a reason to make them even better at defending against infantry invasions. i agree that with enough fighters, aa guns aren't enough to shut down a determined air force."
subject100,0," - i like to rush-buy caravans or gold-producing buildings (like the market). you are literally spending money to make money! but seriously, the increased income helps you quickly rebuild your reserves, and you have the added benefit of the asset you purchased."
subject100,0," - i got civ rev 2 a few weeks ago, and recently uninstalled it. i didn't think it was very good. it was very easy on the lower difficulties and overly difficult to the point of unfun on the highest difficulty. coupled with the cost ($10 usd) and the lack of information (not much explanation on how any mechanics work), i wouldn't recommend it to a fellow civv fan."
subject100,0," - the ai is very poor at valuing their last copy of a luxury resource, which is incredibly frustrating. difficulty level doesn't change matters, unfortunately."
subject100,0, - when the current difficulty isn't fun. when i'm winning science victories and the other ais are 2 eras behind. or when i'm conquering the world with giant death robots and i'm fighting musketmen along the way.
subject100,0," - no. according to civ wiki, only land units can be garrisoned, and only garrisoned units get the oligarchy benefit. since planes can't be garrisoned, they cannot get the oligarchy benefit."
subject100,0," - if those cities you puppeted don't have at least 1 unique luxury resource, raze them (i'd even raze them if a city you are keeping will eventually get that luxury over time with expanded borders). i think your captured city strategy makes sense, so try to get a religion that has +happiness tenets. also, don't be afraid to pick a civ with +happiness ub, rather than a typically 'warmonger' civ for your domination games. one other note: when you capture a city, there will be a several turn period of unrest, as you know by now. during that unrest period, you should always have the cities in 'puppet' mode. you can't do anything in these cities anyways, so you might as well have them in the mode that creates less unhappiness. you can always annex once unrest ends."
subject100,0," - take the lsat without studying and see how you do. there are plenty of diagnostics for free. if you score reasonably well (160+), it won't take more than a few months of dedicated study to get into the 170s, at which point you can go to all but the top 20 schools either for free or with significant scholarships. as a current lawyer, i agree 100% with all the posts here about the legal profession sucking re: hours, jobs being hard to find for new grads, and the high cost of law school. all that being said, though, if you can go to law school for basically nothing, i'd say its a less-crazy decision. one piece of advice that i wish i was able to follow when i made my decision: try to find a lawyer who works at a law firm (the likely landing spot for the vast majority of new lawyers) - your school's career center might have alumni in your town - and reach out to a few people. have lunch with them, ask to visit their offices, get a sense of what their day is like, and what the expected career development paths are."
subject100,0," - i like to play tall when i'm stepping up my difficulty level. but i find wide more immersive, because it just feels right to try to conquer my continent in my civ's colors. cultural is great for wide. lots of cities means lots of buildings to hold great works (offensive), and lots of culture buildings (defensive). science is great for tall, and doable (but a bit harder) for wide. diplo is surprisingly great for tall, since you end up with so much gold going tall that you can buy tons of allies."
subject100,0, - no.
subject100,0," - not really. some people put civs in different tiers (top tier civs being poland, korea, babylon, sometimes shoshone), but most of the other civs' value depends a ton on map type, playstyle and victory condition. for instance, polynesia is excellent on archipelago, but weaker on pangea. incas are amazing on highlands map, but weak on great plains. there are a few civs that are generally considered underpowered (iroquis, denmark, ottomans), but even these civs have their ardent defenders, and plenty of people win deity games using them. its mostly a question of understanding a civ's strengths and weaknesses, and adjusting your gameplay accordingly."
subject100,0," - generally? put spies in their cities to steal techs. send trade routes to them to leech science. if they attack you? use terrain to your advantage: mountains block troops; ais often stupidly embark land units, which can die easily. focus on zerging: make up for quality with quantity. use your quantity to whittle down the ai, while hoping that a few units survive to earn some valuable promotions. pick one unit type to catch up on: if you are an era behind, you can't match his units for all types (melee, naval, ranged, siege and cavalry). so pick one tech line you will focus on so that at least your front line troops can match the ai. at the end of the day, the ai is so bad at war (not shooting and moving; not understanding naval war) that you can probably use tactics to win a defensive war against a stronger ai. its a lot harder to go on the offensive, though."
subject100,0," - on the last one, if you click the button in the upper left corner (where you can choose your tech, or choose your great person counter), there is one for trade resources."
subject100,0," - if you plan on neglecting military (which is fine), make sure to settle your cities in defensive positions. all things being equal, each city you settle probably doesn't have an absolute best settling spot, but rather a series of tradeoffs (like, do i get a luxury in my 2nd ring or 3rd), so take 'defend-ability' into consideration. for instance, if you know that there are ais to the east, try to settle a city where there is a river next to the eastern side of your city. similarly, pick the city spot that is on a hill, or has a mountain adjacent. if you plan on using ranged units to defend, make sure that there aren't forests adjacent to your city that your defenders can't shoot over."
subject100,0," - ua - your game gets really boring 30 minutes after you start :) its a cool idea, though its tough having no special abilities for the first half of the game. it would also be sad if you didn't get oil in your territory, so maybe some sort of start bias that increases the likelihood of spawning near oil?"
subject100,0," - i play on a mac. i like the unlimited barbarian xp mod and the communitas map mod. the xp mod is self-explanatory, and i play on marathon, so its nice to keep having a reason for killing barbs. communitas is a nice update to the typical civ maps by making worlds more realistic. definitely a nice change of pace if you have been playing awhile."
subject100,0," - there is a similar game by mob_cleaner, though he is playing domination-only: https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/3wdi64/world_domination_as_venice_part_2/ it looks like you can expect quite a bit of early war, which might make utilizing your trade routes more challenging that usual. it sounds like a fun game though; i wish i had the computing power for a ynaem marathon game. post screenshots if it goes well!"
subject100,0," - well, consider the math. assume 8 cities, all connected to the capital and all non-occupied. so right off the bat, you're getting 7 extra happiness from city connections. you are then also getting -5% unhappiness, which we can pretend means each citizen gives you 0.05 happiness. that means for every 100 citizens, you are getting 1 happiness. that is not a ton of extra happiness. now consider tradition. you get 1 happiness for every 10 citizens in a city. in this example we have 100 citizens across our empire in 8 cities, there is a maximum of +10 happiness. and you get -1 unhappiness for every 2 citizens in the capital. in a capital of 30 pop (quite reasonable), you have an extra 15 happiness. now, these numbers aren't quite right, due to caps of global and local happiness, and -unhappiness isn't quite the same as +happiness. but as you can see, at the end of the day, tradition can provide some nice happiness bonuses. the problem, of course, is that tradition happiness kicks in once cities get large, and kicks in at cliffs (eg, no happiness at 9 citizens, 1 happiness at 10 citizens). the liberty happiness boost comes early (right when a city is founded), stays steady as population grows, and since it is a percentage multiplier, benefits from rounding up decimals. so, if you can weather the early to mid-game unhappiness and go tradition, you can end up just fine. there are ways to manage missing out on the 7 early happiness from city connections by doing things like settling cities directly on luxury resources (so they immediately connect to your empire), allying with mercantile city states, and spending gold to buy luxuries from ais. its not easy, but when you consider playing a civ like india, where you are trying to get your cities above 6 pop as soon as possible, tradition begins to have a bit more appeal."
subject100,0," - correct, but i think the hammers already spent decay over time. i think its like 50 turns before decay occurs though, so it rarely comes into play (especially for wonders)."
subject100,0, - play teams? split up the good players so that each team is one good player and one new player.
subject100,0," - off-topic, but water cities are a huge part of civ beyond earth:rising tide. i know its a lot to spend that much money on a new game just for one mechanic, though."
subject100,0," - it was not great at launch, but there have been some pretty good fixes with patches. if you think civ v is an a, beyond earth is definitely a b at best. but rising tide got solid reviews (i haven't played it yet). i too am waiting for a steam sale to justify it."
subject100,0," - generally decline dof requests, but if you are playing a map like continents or pangea, and one civ is waaaay over in the corner/on another continent, and its likely that you won't try to capture their cities until last, feel free to dof them. if they are the last civ you end up going to war with, then the more severe diplo penalty ends up being meaningless."
subject100,0, - a popular goal on these boards is a 3 or 4 city tradition empire with a national college built by turn 100. but that sort of speed is only necessary on the highest difficulty levels.
subject100,0," - definitely complete edition (base game, brave new world, gods and kings)."
subject100,0, - i do not. i play on a mac (shame!).
subject100,0," - 1. don't wipe out a civ entirely; get their capital and key cities then make peace. pay ais to attack your target, then declare war afterwards. if you are playing on continent-type landmasses, wipe out any opponents before optics. 2. i like to keep 1 ranged unit in the city, and 1 roaming unit per 2 cities (either cavalry or infantry) to patrol and to deal with barbarians. typically you won't need much defense against your immediate target, since he will attack your invading force. as for defending against a random neighbor dowing you, well that is more situational and requires you to know a bit about their military strength. 3. i believe cities prioritize targeting units in the first ring around the city, and then they prioritize wounded units to healthy units. so keep your siege/ranged units in the second ring, and melee units in the first ring, and you should be fine."
subject100,0," - if you go into the trade screen with an ai, there are options to 'declare war against.' if you click that sub-screen on your trading partner's side, it will bring up a list of the other ais in the game which your trading partner can declare war on. then you can negotiate a price (resources, gold, gpt) the same way you would negotiate open borders, luxuries, strategic resources, etc. sometimes an ai can't be paid to go to war no matter what you offer, but most times you can work something out."
subject100,0," - there's no foolproof way, short of having ships/units provide complete vision on the entire route. of course, such a practice is impractical, because you end up spending more in unit maintenance than you receive from the trade route. in practice, i have a few methods: 1. start with caravans for the first few eras. typically the ai (including city states) is not effective at producing and managing naval units in the early game, so i wait until more of the map is settled (=fewer barb camp spots) and there are more naval units to clear out barb galleys. 2. barbs love to spawn on island chains off the coast. park a scout or 2 on any landmasses that are at common trade route crossroads. 3. open honor. it feels like a waste of a policy, but if i'm playing venice and trade routes are my lifeblood, i don't want to be spending gold/hammers rebuilding my cargo ship fleet, and the honor opener gives you plenty of heads-up to swarm a camp before it can churn out ships."
subject100,0," - i find it to mean 'hard to get.' i've been able to change an ai's mind when offering 6-7 luxuries, but typically when i have so much to offer, it means i'm reasonably strong enough that i don't need a particular ai's help anyways."
subject100,0," - not sure when it came out, but the white walkers mod spawned some popular playthrough albums on the boards in the last few months."
subject100,0," - if you bring a civ back to life by liberating one of its former cities, they will vote for you for world congress."
subject100,0," - focus on researching archery, have a few archers ready behind a warrior or two, and farm him for xp."
subject100,0, - eui - enhanced user interface - is a very popular display mod.
subject100,0, - no. you get a free merchant of venice.
subject100,0," - one other point. most of the turn 300 victories are on the highest difficulties (especially deity). this is important because you leech a lot of science when you are behind in tech, and on deity and immortal, the ai starts out with several free techs and a free settler(s) (meaning quicker cities, meaning faster early science). since the ais will be ahead of you in tech for most of the game, your science moves faster from: 1. science from trade routes; 2. more techs to steal with spies; 3. research agreements provide more science; and 4. tech costs decrease when you meet more ais who already have the tech."
subject100,0," - venice is a lot of fun, and on a large or huge map, its a major challenge when your competition has 5-10 cities, and you have 1 real city and some puppets for trading. venice is one of my favorite civs though, because i love rush-buying units and buildings with gold, and spending all my hammers on wonders."
subject100,0," - taking through various mechanics would be cool, but i don't know about trading tiles. the ai is already poor at valuing its resources; i feel like the tile trading system would either be very easily gamed (because the ai wouldn't be good at valuing certain strategically important tiles like a choke point), or would be mostly frustrating (because the ai would never make a reasonable trade if you were trying to acquire a tile with a luxury)."
subject100,0," - for me, it depends on what my victory goals are. if i'm going for domination, i just re-schedule my ai targets so that i pick up the resource early in my expansion. if i'm going for science (and need aluminum for spaceship parts), i'll either buy out a cs or settle some terrible tundra city (this decision is further dictated by my ideology policies and my happiness). if i'm going for cultural or diplomatic, i just suck it up and go without. while it may result in a suboptimal military, the non-resource units are more than effective enough to keep you alive."
subject100,0," - well, in a perfect world, you'd take only her capital. the capital is usually the ai's best city, so you want it. there are also major diplomatic penalties for completely destroying another civ, so usually its a good idea to take the enemy's capital (and maybe one or two other high-population cities), but leave the crappy cities around. the enemy will be kind of a pain for the rest of the game, but you won't have the rest of the world hating you, and you can still trade with dido."
subject100,0," - keep your units alive. promoted units that have survived a few wars become a huge advantage against the ai's terrible fighting ability. getting ranged, siege or naval units with range+logistics means you can capture any city you want. getting several melee units with medic and cover means the ai can't bombard you away from their cities. coupled with hammers saved in your cities, and you can quickly snowball."
subject100,0," - first, you don't need to 'make' money. you just need to not lose money: -send trade routes to city state or ai civs, instead of internally. -forego certain buildings in your satellite/smaller cities (like not building a barracks everywhere). -build trade buildings (market, banks, etc.) once they are immediately available, and put them in the queue behind other buildings. -leave some cities undefended, but use a road system so that in the event of attack, you can quickly move units to assist. -if you are pursuing war/domination, pillage every tile, even if you don't need the health boost. similarly, if you are at war with an ai, send a cavalry unit/tank to their lands and spend the whole time pillaging/stealing workers while avoiding fights/city bombards. -later in the game, set production to 'wealth' in some of the smaller, less important cities."
subject100,0," - i frequently play huge/marathon, and i've recently added ""unlimited xp - barbarians"" (i think that's the mod). i find it makes barb hunting from those huge swaths of unclaimed land lots more enjoyable. instead of just getting frustrated by another task slowing you down, you can enjoy getting some xp. as for leaders, most leaders don't change much when you expand the map size. korea and babylon lose some of their op-ness, since you can't pull away in science using a 4-city science turtle when several ais have 20+ cities. other leaders with early era bonuses or buildings (i include poland and shoshone in this group) can snowball a lot easier, because the early game lasts several hundred turns, so you have an advantage for significantly longer. conversely, some leaders with late-game uus, like america, are less effective, because you are playing 1,000+ turns before you can utilize them. a few civs become a bit more effective, but again, no one becomes either totally op or totally useless. a few civs that move up a tier (in my book) on marathon/huge: -polynesia - exploring the whole map very early on gets you tons of cs meeting boosts, and gets you the science boost from having met other civs. -alexander/siam - cs alliances are much harder to keep on marathon, due to decay, so these guys become even better at diplomacy. -venice - the extra gold makes a huge difference early and mid-game on marathon, because you can avoid hard-building units and buildings, and only wonder-whore. it can be effective to wonder-whore until artillery, then go domination, but that might not be your cup of tea. -songhai/germany - on huge maps, their ua stays relevant longer, which is a nice change of pace from normal games (and couples well with the barb xp mod)."
subject100,0," - agreed. but remember on marathon that it will take 30 turns to build a warrior, so it is much harder to quickly respond to an ai dow or backstab. if you see a carpet of units headed your way, you can't quickly react like you can on quick or standard, and you are likely effed. and on huge, since the ai's bonuses to happiness and growth will apply to significantly more cities, it is even harder to match them in empire size prior to ideologies. so i like to think of the xp boost to my military as a nice counter to the ai bonuses that are balanced around much smaller maps and quicker gameplay."
subject100,0," - recent thread discussing japan: https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/3r386t/civ_of_the_month_japan/ the main complaints about japan boil down to 1. bombers are better than fighters, so the zero isn't hugely useful. 2. samarais come late in the game, so you've probably already built most of the fishing boats you will ever need, so their real benefit are 2 free promotions (which only works if you build them, not upgrade them from prior units). 3. the culture from the ua is nice, but not game-breaking. 4. the wounded unit bonus is nice, but in practice you want your wounded units to retreat and heal, rather than press further attacks. again, not a bad civ like the iroquis by any means, but nothing special."
subject100,0," - right, but even fighters still require either gold/hammers and unit maintenance. so while you do not have the usual fighter/bomber tradeoff off where other civs have to decide whether 'wasting' oil on fighters makes sense, at the end of the day you still have to spend some effort producing fighters, and you are probably going to focus on bombers instead. it is certainly nice that the fighters you do build won't consume oil, so you might build a few more than you'd otherwise need. but oil isn't terribly expensive to trade for or to get from a cs, which is why this ua is considered 'okay' and not 'good' (the op's original question)."
subject100,0," - sure, but its not optimal. but when i'm playing a map where i'm near tundra (likely more barb camps), or as a civ with bonuses to clearing barbs or early offense (aztecs, germany, songhai), i'll try honor. but there are lots of posts showing the math that the extra culture earned does not justify 'wasting' a social policy on the opener, and that choosing it ultimately delays when you complete the rationalism tree."
subject100,0," - i use them so long as i would still have growth after a reasonable number of turns. i can't give a hard and fast number about what is 'reasonable,' but i would say that doubling the number of turns until growth would make me pause."
subject100,0, - i believe there is a mod called 'smart ai' on the steam workshop that improves the ai. the community balance patch also builds in some ai improvements (but also drastically alters the base game).
subject100,0, - the only way i can think of is to have a spy in a particular ai city. then find that city on the map and look for the wonder icons.
subject100,0," - i like: -polynesia on terra - you can send your first settler and warrior to the unpopulated new world. -england on archipelago - you can easily conquer the world once you research ship of the line. -zulu, the mongols or the huns on great plans - really fun for domination victories. for more general settings, i like setting the world age to old (i think 5 billion years old?), which results in more mountain ranges. i also like to set luxuries to 'abundant,' if i feel like playing wide, so that i can juggle happiness more easily."
subject100,0," - unfortunately not. defensive pacts are pretty worthless, other than the minor diplomacy boost they grant to your friends. and as bad as your scenario is, it can be even worse. in your scenario, imagine spain declares war on you. sweden would declare war on spain, but there's nothing preventing sweden and spain from making peace the very next turn..."
subject100,0," - one city. in nearly all cases, it will be your capital, which will have your national college. there are several reasons, and they all relate to how certain science buildings and wonders multiply a city's science. first, science is based on population. so that +50% bonus that the national college provides gives you more bang for your buck in the city with the highest population (all other things equal), which is typically your capital. second, your capital usually has the highest production and shortest build queue. therefore, you will be building science buildings in your capital first. so you are getting a few extra turns of the research lab and university multipliers in your capital before your satellite cities. third, your multiplier buildings (nc, rl, uni, observatory) also multiply the science produced by specialists. like point 1, your capital usually has the highest population, and therefore can utilize specialists earlier while still maintaining growth and working valuable tiles. there are a few scenarios where it might make more sense to focus your science wonders/academies in your second city. for instance, your second city is adjacent to a mountain and has lake victoria, so it will quickly catch your capital in population). or you might be stuck in a protracted war where you need to focus capital production on military units, and you don't want the ai to steal a later wonder like oxford. but those scenarios are rare, and it is a safer bet to just go for the capital."
subject100,0," - good point. i was thinking porcelain tower maybe? i'm always surprised by how few ""science"" world wonders there, compared to culture and military."
subject100,0," - generally yes. while you may end up in the late-game having ""too much population"" and unemployed citizens, you are still getting science and hammers from these citizens. but the more important reason is because in mid-game you'll have a much larger city. spending the industrial era with a 25 pop capital vs. a 20 pop capital can give you the production and research boost (with specialists) you need to snowball. only looking at the final population of your city ignores that population size matters throughout the game. people definitely play wide and do the opposite (send all trade routes from the capital to satellite cities), and you end up with 6-7 strong cities, and with observatories and jungles you can still keep up with science, so its not absolutely necessary."
subject100,0," - depends on how 'good' those coastal cities are. if they are crummy 4-pop cities that you settled much later, its probably not a good idea, because you won't have much production and have to rush-buy all your science buildings. that can get expensive for 3 cities. it would probably be easier to just keep them all at the nc, or focus on one of these coastal cities. also depends on what improvements you'd have to replace with the academies. i'm guessing a mountain coastal city doesn't have a ton of free land tiles to fill up with academies."
subject100,0," - depends on when that mountain coastal city comes online, right? if it is your 3rd or 4th city, and your only coastal city (so you can't feed it with cargo ships), its probably not going to catch up in population to justify not using your capital."
subject100,0," - yeah, so by 40 (and probably earlier in your case) you can stop sending food routes. as a general rule, i think you want a food route to the capital until you have more people than you can efficiently use. but morocco/petra/river is not a typical scenario, so you can probably ignore a few of the civ 'general rules.'"
subject100,0," - sounds like a cool mod. i'll have to check it out. 1,300 gpt means the extra +4 science from each gs probably won't matter a ton either way."
subject100,0," - generally the 'suggested' settling sites focus too much on the existence of luxuries and strategic resources in the first ring, and ignores or undervalues other very important city location points, like: -being on a river; -being adjacent to a mountain; -being at a strategic chokehold; -being on a hill; or -being on the coast. i wouldn't just default settle on suggested sites. read a few ""where should i settle"" threads on this board, and you'll see what you should be looking for."
subject100,0," - there are lots of methods (some prior threads below), but nearly everyone starts by building a scout. early game is about exploration, and scouts are the best exploration units. scouting lets you find the best locations for your later cities, lets you find ancient ruins, lets you find barbarian camps (to avoid them), and lets you meet city states (who give bonuses and quests). i think most people build monuments next (or build a second scout), but that can vary whether you want to focus on getting an early religion (build a shrine then), and whether you got any religion or cultural ruins (monuments aren't as important if you get a cultural ruin and can open tradition). after that, your playstyle is going to dictate your build order. if you go liberty, don't build a settler until you get the policy that reduces settler build times. if you go honor or want to rush a neighbor's capital, you probably want to start building a military that will help you succeed (as well as focusing on military techs). if you find yourself isolated on a small island and can't steal a worker from a cs, you need to add a worker to your build order. as for what to research, again, that depends on your start. if you want a religion, then yes, go for pottery. otherwise people often choose to research the technologies they will need to build on the luxuries they can improve (e.g., if you have a salt start, get mining first). https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1mfqb2/can_we_get_a_build_order_thread_going/ https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/2241kk/what_are_your_starting_build_orders/"
subject100,0," - if you search 'civ v ai trait,' you can find the 'flavors' of each ai (i can't link due to being at work and 'game' sites being filtered). there is a reddit thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/16gr41/the_big_chart_of_ai_bias_what_they_are_likely_to/) but the chart isn't very readable. an explanation of the values can be found here: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/ai_trait_(civ5) i think to your second point, everyone has a slightly different 'ai nemesis' that always seems to succeed. everyone seems to hate alexander, but if you ask 10 civ v players for the ai that 'always snowballs when left alone,' i think you'd get 10 different answers."
subject100,0," - in addition to searching this subreddit, the civ v wiki breaks down quite a bit of the math. http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/civilization_v civfanatics is also a good site for explaining the math behind certain mechanics too."
subject100,0," - sorry, but i disagree. if you can get cities (and monuments) out fast, you can get free amphitheaters instead once you research drama and poetry. amphitheaters costs 2.5x the hammers of a monument, so it can be a nice savings of production and gold maintenance. plus, if you don't get any cultural ruins (or a culture pantheon), it can be slow going to even unlock legalism if you don't build a monument."
subject100,0," - i'm pretty sure all wonders (world and national) decrease global unhappiness, and all buildings decrease local unhappiness. to your 3rd point, at higher difficulties, the ai will always be able to settle more cities until ideologies, because the ai gets tons of +happiness bonuses. if you are struggling to stay happy, you can settle cities on top of unique luxuries to immediately connect them (if you have the requisite technology). that saves you a few turns of unhappiness if you don't have enough workers to spare to improve tiles in satellite cities. if you are going tall (i.e., filling out the tradition social policy), aim for 4 cities. if you are going wide (i.e., filling out the liberty social policy), you can aim for more. if you struggle with happiness early in the game, religion can be your friend. some religious tenets, like mosques or pagodas, are a nice way to boost your happiness relatively cheaply early in the game."
subject100,0," - one way that might work is to copy spore's mechanic. currently, you can unlock the whole world under the right circumstances in the ancient era. this isn't terribly realistic. imagine instead a game where in the ancient/classical era, you can't really progress more than 100 tiles from your capital. then when you breach the classical era, you 'unlock' more of the world, and guess what, in the previous fog of war are some much stronger ais! so while you did well in the first 2 eras and pulled ahead, you now have 4-5 new neighbors who are a few techs ahead of you. you could do this 3-4 times until the renaissance era. one downside of the 'crash' events that i experienced in galactic civilzations 2 (which was a great game), is that inevitably you have games where you get hit with 4-5 brutal events that really set you back, and one of the ais either dodges the events entirely or gets hits with events that don't really affect it. which can be nearly impossible to overcome."
subject100,0, - enhanced user interface (eui).
subject100,0," - the expansions are often available for pretty good discounts during steam sales. not sure when the next one will be though, since the winter sale ended 10 days ago."
subject100,0," - first, you don't need to reset for a good spawn. if you are playing basic settings with the appropriate number of civs and city states (meaning you are not putting 16 ai civs on a small map), your starting point should be perfectly good enough to get your empire running. second, to get better, play a game where you tell yourself you will not build a world wonder no matter what. sometimes trying for world wonders can set you back in your infrastructure, and other buildings (like markets and coliseums) and units (like caravans) would actually be better for long-term success. third, if you are having trouble with gold, i'd recommend building science and gold buildings (so library, market, etc.) for each era first, foregoing military buildings (so no barracks, armories, etc.), and building other types of buildings (growth/food, culture) after. fourth, you might have too much of a military? unless i'm at war, i typically only want 1-2 units per city (and you should have at least 3 cities for tradition, and 5 for liberty), plus whatever units you have to guard your trade routes and explore the map. too many units can be tough on your economy until later in the game."
subject100,0," - i agree its hard to pass up all those tasty wonders. but if you pass them up in the early eras, you can get such a big tech lead and such strong capital production that by the industrial era and onward, you can basically have your pick of wonders, and in the much later eras (modern, information), you can have all of the good ones (which are admittedly few and far between)."
subject100,0," - 1. play without building wonders. it forces you to focus on infrastructure and not get bogged down by shiny things. 2. play a game with the express intent of winning a cultural victory, then a diplo victory, etc. read up on how to win each victory (e.g., how tourism/influence works to get you cultural victories). 3. avoid the 'specialty' civs (i consider venice and india as examples, where they alter the base game mechanics significantly) if you are struggling on a difficulty level. 4. don't be afraid to fail. the game will get old quickly if you play on difficulty 2 and win every game by launching nukes at the ai's warriors."
subject100,0," - 1. don't throw down cities in the desert just avoid the fog of war. it hurts science/culture, and if you get forward-settled, the city won't be of any real consequence. it will feel like a knife in your back, but the reality is that the city will not be able to produce much of an army, and the ai doesn't use airports well. 2. i'd probably raze even the strategic cities if they are no longer on my continent and if they do not have unique luxuries. after a certain point, the hardest part of domination on a huge map is reinforcing your army. i typically find myself rush-buying the military and production buildings in capitals, and using those to pump out units. if you force yourself to say double the number of cities you are using to produce units, you are probably throwing away a lot of gold. (this advice probably changes once you get planes, and need cities to base them in range of your armies). 3. to point #2, have 4-5 workers move with the army (or ahead of it before you declare war) to chop trees and build roads where it makes sense. clearing out forest can make your invasion force move much faster and can give you clean lines of sight on defenders. 4. for tech, i'd go for industrialization next. you probably have coal and can get your ideology first."
subject100,0," - i'd probably just chop a path to england. the problem with settling mid to late game is that, even if the city grows large enough, it does not produce enough science and culture over its lifetime to justify the increased tech/policy costs, not to mention the gold you spend getting the city on line. remember that the likely settlers of this area are the civs that you've already crushed under your boot. so if alex re-settles in the area, the city will be puny, he will be too weak to be a real threat, and he is probably several eras behind you in tech. its much cheaper to just have a few bombers in your capital to mop up any stray attacker. its not like the new enemy city will have borders large enough to block your army's desired path. i have the same struggle as you on large and huge maps. i want the whole map to be my civ's color, like i'm playing risk, or a total war game. unfortunately, in a competitive game of civ, that is really hard to do. if you find yourself an era ahead of every other ai, then you can definitely settle these extra cities as an exercise in rp (which can be fun), but you end up having much longer turns as you micro-manage each city. and if the other ais are close to you (or even ahead), if you spend all these resources building up some mediocre 'just because' cities, you might be facing some seriously difficult wars (with nukes) by the time you resume your warmongering. one other benefit to rushing to ideologies is that your happiness concerns mostly go away, because of all the policies that boost happiness in order and autocracy (your 2 best choices for world domination)."
subject100,0," - i've heard the community balance patch (cbp) changes the mechanics so that these resources stay relevant throughout the later eras. granted, cbp changes a ton of other stuff too, so it might be more than you're looking for."
subject100,0," - [sorry for the late reply]. if you have built every useful building, and have an army sufficient for your needs, and have all of your trade routes filled, and have all your national wonders and guilds built, and aren't currently researching a key building (like research labs), then you can build wonders, sure. i personally play on slower speeds (marathon), so i am very rarely in the situation where i've built everything useful in my building queue completed. but i agree that there will be times when it happens, and when it does, sure, go for a wonder. edit: and again, my 'no wonders' advice is not for every game. its mostly for a game or three where you figure out what each building does, and figure out how to balance science, gold, growth and culture. after a few games, you'll be good enough to know ""hey, i have a pretty good start right now, and the potential for a good religion, so i'm going to try to grab stonehenge,"" for example. and if you don't get stonehenge, you'll know how to prioritize your build order so that you can make up for the lost productivity."
subject100,0," - i think the current system of pillaging the tiles around a city is sufficient at recreating siege-like effects (lower production, starvation from lack of food). and if you start adding in all of these logistics-type measures for defenders, it doesn't make sense/work too well unless you add them for attackers, and now you've opened up an entirely new can of worms. i don't see adding all of these decisions as being terribly fun in a war against the ai where every other turn for 15 turns they get a melee unit in range of a city, and the game triggers all of these decisions. if you want a better feel of sieges, i think a better siege unit would be more fun, rather than the current form of catapult/trebuchets which are way too squishy and never used by the human player. rome and medieval total war had interesting siege mechanics, but it also became a way to cheese defensive structures, because you could just wait x number of turns to automatically win, or force the defenders to come attack you."
subject100,0," - its a pretty poorly done mechanic, unfortunately. i understand wanting to avoid duplicating the civ v city state, but be went too far, and the stations are basically worthless unless you invest a ton of your own units to keep them alive."
subject100,0," - while i don't want to halt the hiawatha bashing (since it kills me that the iroquis excel as an ai but leave so much to be desired when you control them), i find that many times an ai will request gold with a research agreement because otherwise the ai can't afford the agreement's costs. a nice work-around (or cheese) is to offer him 5x horses or iron (assuming you aren't using them if ras are available), since each ai values strategics at 1gpt (for me at least)."
subject100,0," - turn 1 - ""you have uncovered the location of nearby barbarian camps."" turn 3 - ""you have discovered a crudely drawn map of the area."" -reveals shaka's capital and a greek scout..."
subject100,0," - great point. i love all these ""what i want for civ vi"" threads, but i feel like too many suggestions focus on creating even more micro-management opportunities that would really bog the game down in certain common situations."
subject100,0, - agreed. i find the ai is usually bad at using specialists and using great people appropriately. not surprising that the ai would then not utilize korea's strength.
subject100,0, - great suggestion!
subject100,0," - agreed, but i always took issue with the assumption in games like r:tw that the people inside the city need to worry about/have a limited supply of food, but the army outside the gates has infinite food. throughout siege history, supplying the sieging army was a difficult proposition, and that issue was just hand-waved away for the attacking army. i actually liked how a besieged army would slowly lose a few units per turn of the siege (to mimic disease, hunger, desertion), so i don't want to sound too down on the total war mechanic. i know it wasn't really cheesing, too, because spending 7-10 turns with your army parked outside a city is a real opportunity cost: you could be doing something else with that army, and you could be attacked by outside forces mid-siege, so its not like a siege was an automatic 'i win.' i guess i was just always a bit disappointed how, at least in my games, one ai sieging another ai typically ended in the auto-win after x turns."
subject100,0," - i disagree. your concept is encouraging zergs. if i just surround a city with 6 scouts/warriors for as long as i can, it seems like i'm guaranteed to wear down a city. at least now there is some use of tactics in city placement (hills/forests improving line of fire) and in army approach (avoiding rivers, moving ranged units to hills). to your point about walls/palace, this is going to make early expansion incredibly hard. now you need 2-3 military units for each city (or you need to build walls first) just to contend with barbarians. doesn't sound like much fun."
subject100,0," - but if sieges need food and supplies, how come the rest of your army, during non-siege times, doesn't? plus, the way most maps are set up, it is suicide to surround many cities, because it forces you to walk your troops past the cities (exposing them to ranged attacks for 2-3 turns), and if you move towards an ai's capital, your sieging units now have their backs to the reinforcements coming in."
subject100,0, - definitely. it was completely realistic and true to history. it just wasn't as much fun from a gameplay perspective.
subject100,0," - ah, i'll check it out. i guess i don't see how new mechanics make things much different than pillaging the countryside. if you pillage the enemy's farms (and the city is sufficiently advanced), chances are they will start losing population over time. now, the city doesn't surrender from starvation, but it is a very effective tool at weakening your opponent."
subject100,0, - but the flip side is: can you really expect an invading army to block off all the mountain passes of a previously unknown territory? seems much more likely and realistic that food/reinforcements could get in over a mountain.
subject100,0," - i always wished there was a way to link the total war games together: your roman empire becomes your starting medieval territory; your medieval territory dictates how powerful you start in empire:total war. even if it meant that you lost something in the transition (maybe to reflect a partial rebellion) so you don't start completely overpowered. i loved the continuity that mass effect (and some other) rpgs let you keep from sequel to sequel; it would be cool if 4x games found a way to recreate that. and you are 100% accurate about not enough 'sim city.' it is very rare that you were ever making decisions about what to build in your cities. maybe you ignored walls and stables in your inner cities, but otherwise its just a matter of do you decide on food, gold or happiness first in each conquered city."
subject100,0," - can't emphasize this enough. this mechanic sounds really interesting in the abstract, when you envision your 5 spearman, 10 crossbow, 2 knight army dominating everyone on pangea. the reality of having this screen pop up every time your scout 1v1's a handaxe, or your trireme attacks a galley, would be so tedious. the outcomes of most fights wouldn't change from this mechanic, and it would just slow things down."
subject100,0," - just not sure if this is very fun, or if the ai would be any good at handling it. it would certainly be more realistic, but is that always the goal? some other thoughts: this would make scouting nearly impossible, unless scouts aren't considered military units anymore. how do you balance what the 'right' total number of supply caravans is? meaning you're possibly gimping warmongers if they can only have 2 armies in the ancient era, etc. it seems like a pretty easy mechanic to defeat from the player's perspective: just send a cavalry unit around the invaders, and snipe the caravan on its way back (like you'd do with a trade route). do you actually build supply caravans (and associated buildings)? seems like building up a military is production-heavy enough as is. the friendly city resupply makes sense, but it encourages a game of leapfrog, where you buy friendships near your target, take your target, then keep the city. now you have territory next to your enemy, and the 'caravan' mechanic is kind of moot. i guess i'm not sure what current failing of warmongering in civ this fixes, and again, reality for reality's sake isn't always the most fun. this is one of the better thought-out 'supply route' ideas i've seen though."
subject100,0, - game speed also affects this decision. waiting 10 turns to settle can be disasterous on quick; it can be a minor setback on marathon.
subject100,0," - archeology helps a ton. use all of your great people to produce works, instead of the insta-bonuses (culture from a writer, golden age from artist, concert from musician). it can be hard if you go super-wide (10+ cities) to fill all of your great works slots no matter what, though."
subject100,0," - commenting on huge maps, because that's what i nearly exclusively play: huge maps make (solely) cultural victory pretty tough. you likely won't meet many of the ais for a large portion of the game. you won't have trade routes with most of the ais. you won't have a shared religion with most of the ais. it is easier to get archeological findings, since there are tons more dig sites, and the ai isn't good at prioritizing them, but i find that this doesn't make up for the lack of tourism multipliers. diplo + a bit of warmongering (where you wipe out the 2 or 3 highest cultural civs) works pretty well to overcome the lack of multipliers though. you're right that domination means more capitals to conquer. however, i find that warmonger penalties are easier to manage on huge maps, because you have so much more room (and therefore more warning) once you'd cleared out your starting island chain/continent/corner of the map. sure, everyone will hate you, but if it takes them 20 turns to get to you after declaring war (or when your spy gives you notice), you have plenty of time to set up defenses. on a smaller map, i find that once the chain dows start, it can be hard when each neighbor sends a wave of attackers against you for wiping out a civ. another point on huge maps is that later games, domination gets very easy, because if you control 4-5 capitals, you are probably miles ahead of the rest of the world in production and growth (and probably hold some nice wonders), so you can snowball quite a bit. there are more annoyances to micromanage (like tooons of barb camps), but most of them can be overcome by making decisions that usually aren't considered optimal (like opening honor for the barb camp notices). i think diplo victories are about the same. you're right that there are more cses, but that gets balanced out by needing more votes to win. i find votes are bit easier to come by. more ais = more likely an ai gets wiped out = you can resurrect an ai civ or cs for lifetime support). further, there are more cses in geographically useless/remote areas that the ais don't focus on (sometimes a cs will go a whole game without an ally), so when the time for a vote rolls around, you can easily buy the alliance of these cses. science i find to be about the same, but i also play on marathon, so i never have a good sense whether science is going 'faster' for a particular game vs. the benchmarks usually discussed here. one benefit is that more civs = more potential research agreements, so if you have the gold and the diplomatic skill, you can have half a dozen ras each era pretty easily."
subject100,0, - great point re: game speed. quick/huge just seems impossible for anything except sv.
subject100,0," - same for me, but with macs. hopefully some of these changes/ideas make it to civ vi, and i can enjoy them then."
subject100,0, - its the best!
subject100,0, - i don't think so.
subject100,0," - i like earthquakes/meteors either creating or flooding land tiles, but i'd hope its a feature you could enable/disable, like raging barbarians. i think it could also be interesting to have global weather effects like an ice age, with effects like ""the world is now much colder, all farms produce 1 less food."" the problem with ice ages is that they last longer than an entire game of civ (10k+ years), so it would really slow down your game if halfway through global production and population fell precipitously. i'd also enjoy more dynamic map effects: for instance being able to tunnel under mountains, or build bridges across 2 water tiles, that if pillaged would be unusable (not just that you lose the movement speed boost, but you can no longer pass through them). similarly, being able to irrigate a desert tile so that it is more useful. there would need to be serious costs/limits associated to how much of the map you can tweak, but it would be an interesting way to spruce up an otherwise decent city location."
subject100,0," - i'd have to check, but at least 10. i usually play in 1-2 hour chunks of time, and i'll usually get through an era per play session."
subject100,0, - yes.
subject100,0," - yes, especially if the map dictates that other units/buildings should be higher priority, or if you want to secure a religion. many players actually get their first worker by stealing it from a city-state or nearby ai. you can declare war for one turn, nab a worker with your scout, and then run away back home. you can then pretty easily make peace without any long-term disadvantage."
subject100,0," - i play marathon/huge. settings: raging barbs, ancient ruins, saving social policies and promotions. i usually up the number of ai and city states by 2-4 (so 14 ai on a huge map, 28-30 cses). map type: i like the communitas map mod, but i enjoy all of the base maps globe-based (fractal, earth, archipelago). i play with all kinds of civs/all styles. no one civ is particularly useless on longer games, but below are a few strategies i've enjoyed that seem to work better on larger maps with slower games: i like venice domination games, because by the time you have the great galleas available, you have 10-12 trade routes and are pulling in close to 150 gpt and can buy a very strong army. i like aztec/honor domination games, because you can get a huge social policy lead since jaguars are effective/relevant for several hundred turns. i like songhai/diplo games, since you can run around forever clearing barb camps for city states, growing rich and making friends for 500 turns. i like egypt/superwide/wonderwhore games, since you have your ub to keep up your early game happiness from city spam while your capital focuses on wonders and settlers."
subject100,0," - correct: http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/tourism_(civ5) don't forget that your tourism output is multiplied under certain circumstances (trade, religion, etc.)."
subject100,0," - one point separate from what is mentioned below. as difficulty levels go up, basically all victory types (domination, diplomacy, cultural) also become science victories. you will need to step up your science game because even if you are a flawless military tactician, if you are fielding units that are an era behind your enemy, you are going to have a bad time. so by all means focus on your military infrastructure, but also make sure that you are maximizing your science output (by researching the right techs, building science buildings, ensuring growth in your core cities)."
subject100,0, - are that many people really looking to rename natural wonders into 'poopy pee butthole caves'? can't wait for 500 posts a week of 'lol look at the wonder name i gave gbr!'...
subject100,0," - but you have world wonders from our history? why is it a problem to have the great barrier reef away from australia, but its fine if the incans build the pyramids? and i don't want to see them go the way of beyond earth, where all the wonders were just made-up names, and you didn't immediately recognize each one from the relevant tech path until you had 100+ hours in..."
subject100,0," - i rarely replace improvements. if something was useful early in the game, i suspect it will be useful mid- or late-game (of course ignoring if a new strategic resource - coal, aluminum or uranium pops up on a farm - then its becoming a mine). i can't find the exact math on when roads become profitable, but i generally build roads to a new city as soon as i can (meaning there are no good tile improvements left around my current cities). certainly by the time your new city reaches 6 pop (assuming the new city is 6 tiles from your existing city)."
subject100,0, - america is pretty good when used by a human. it doesn't fare as well with the ai because the ai can't utilize its unique abilities very well. a human player knows how to maximize his scout's search path to reveal the most terrain in the fewest moves; the ai moves around like a chicken with its head cut off. a human player knows when to buy a particularly useful tile early on to work it (either a luxury or a strategic choke point); the ai rarely buys tiles. a human knows how to press air warfare to great effect; the ai generally sucks at war.
subject100,0," - yes. on the main screen, there should be a dlc button. if you click that, you can disable your dlc."
subject100,0," - wasn't clear what parker was saying, but wanted to make a point why automating workers isn't a good idea, even if you always follow the recommended build. while you may end up with the same improvements, automated workers (a) won't always build in the best order (e.g., improving luxuries before grassland farms) and (b) won't always build improvements in cities that need them the most (i.e., if your capital is 6 pop, and 8 tiles around your city are improved, there's no point in improving more tiles until your population matches the number of tiles you can work; you are much better served having those workers build roads or build improvements around satellite cities)."
subject100,0," - good question. i'd say it depends on the luxuries and what the rest of the city looks like. your overriding goal for young cities is food. the more food you get, the faster the city grows, the more tiles you can work, the more food you get, etc. etc. so if you are in a city surrounded by desert luxuries (like copper) and plains, you probably want to get the plains upgraded first, because you won't be working those copper mines, because if you do, you won't grow. on the other hand, if those luxuries are salt (and will grant food improved), you will want to improve those. my general rule for working early tiles is a balancing of ""what will maximize my tile outputs (meaning the most 'resources' per citizen - so 2 food, 1 prod, 2 gold beats 3 food, since 5  gt; 3)"" and ""what will keep my city growing (meaning while 1 prod 3 gold beats 3 food, i don't need gold more than i need growth)."" one caveat to all of this: improving luxuries grants you happiness. if your empire is unhappy, you will suffer empire-wide growth and production losses. therefore, if you settle a new city and are unhappy, you should improve the luxury resources associated with that city asap, because while it might stunt the growth of this one particularly city, it will benefit your empire as a whole."
subject100,0," - agreed. england's domination doesn't start for a few eras (until you unlock the longbow). so if you go tradition or liberty, you can build up a strong empire, and when you unlock the longbow, you have lots of strong cities to crank out the units. if you open with honor right away, you either are warring with regular units (spearmen and archers) and you won't be much better than any other civ, or you are peacefully building your empire with social policies that don't really help your growth."
subject100,0, - i think its half of the population until you get enough influence or certain policies.
subject100,0," - beyond earth isn't the best game, but you should try it out if its basically free on a steam sale soon. the switch from happiness to city health makes going super-wide very easy."
subject100,0," - if your unit is in your territory, and there is an upgrade available, there will be a star/arrow icon in the lower left (same spot as the other commands, like fortify, defend, etc.). it costs gold to upgrade obsolete military units."
subject100,0," - one of the fun parts of civ is that ais will randomly backstab you (some leaders are more likely than others). the decision to attack you takes a few things into consideration, including whether they want your territory, whether they want any wonders you have, whether they are stronger than you militarily. so even if you trade and have open borders (which help in diplomatic relations), you still might get attacked. to get revenge (and to stop it from happening again), build up an army. a basic army involves 4-6 ranged units (archers, bowmen, etc. depending on the era), and 3-4 melee units (warriors, spearmen, etc.). you use the melee units to form a wall in front of your archers; the ai runs their units into your warriors, you use your archers to shoot the enemy and then heal your warriors. if you have enough gold and production, build a few cavalry units and siege units too to play around with them."
subject100,0," - the community balance patch (cbp) improves the ai a bit. however, the ai improvement is across all difficulty levels, so its not quite what you are looking for. the total war series has somewhat smarter ai. total war also has 2 difficulty levels (for the meta-gaming, empiring building part, and for the battlefield tactics part), which i find cool. galactic civ 2 (i haven't played gal civ 3) also has a smarter ai at higher difficulty levels."
subject100,0," - you can't know if you will win the wonder race, but if you spy on other civs, you will get notices if they start to build a wonder. if you can physically see their city through the fog of war, you can also see the map icon of the wonder once construction begins, so it might give you a hint. my best advice though is to play without trying for any wonders until you are comfortable with regular buildings. you don't need wonders to win."
subject100,0," - early on, yes. there are some exceptions though: -if a city won't be used to build military units, skip barracks, etc. -if a city won't be used to send caravans, skip the caravansary. also, building order matters a lot. you want to build food/growth buildings and science buildings first, all other things considered. later on, you will want to give some more thought to certain buildings, because (a) later buildings get expensive, and (b) later in the game you want to be focusing on your victory objectives. for instance, if you have enough aluminum, don't build recycling centers. if you aren't concerned about your neighbors nuking you, don't build bomb shelters. typically the ai only sends spies to your capital, so your satellite cities probably don't need constabularies. if your city is protected by other cities, you probably don't need walls, etc. if your city is small and kind of crappy, you probably don't need windmills or a solar power plant late in the game. if you aren't going for a science victory, don't build a spaceship factory."
subject100,0," - i typically go with one ranged unit in every city (which ends up being free if i go tradition), and 2-3 roaming infantry or cavalry units. i find this is plenty to keep back barbarians. i might have more if foreign trade routes need protection too."
subject100,0," - i loved galciv2, and i'm almost glad that my laptop can't handle galciv3, given some of the troubles that i've read about. best to have happy memories of a series..."
subject100,0," - i think in this instance, you are right about not opening honor, but generally i disagree. in this instance, there are so few places for barb camps to spawn around berlin (due to css, and then new cities), so 1. there won't be many camps, and 2. you can reasonably guess where the camps will be. but if this map was more spread out, i'd happily open honor. one of the main advantages of the german ua is that you don't need to hard-build any units early on. you use your starting warrior to take a camp (you only need 1 warrior until hand-axes show up), and hope that your 1 warrior is now 2 warriors. now your pair of warriors goes to the next camp. etc. germany is one of the better civs to open honor, because they feel the lost productivity less. while they don't get the +hammer boosts of tradition or liberty, they make up for the lack of boosts by never (or rarely) having to hard-build units for the first few eras."
subject100,0," - definitely agree that honor is suboptimal. but with civs like germany, you can definitely use the honor opener (or even full honor) to make up for the lack of tradition growth. it just means that you have to build up your army and then actually use it to take a capital or two early on in the game. otherwise, you're absolutely right, you end up with no growth and no gold, because your large barbarian army costs upkeep. but if you build up a decent army, with the expectation that half of it gets wiped out in city sieges (since you mainly recruit melee units, only a few ranged, and never siege units), you can end up with 2 occupied capitals and a reasonably sized army. again, agreed its not optimal. you really have to adapt the traditional 4-city tall tradition science/diplo/wait til artillery domination strategies. but germany can definitely make it work."
subject100,0," - all your points are spot on. but since op isn't playing deity, i'm just saying honor (while usually not great) isn't completely terrible when coupled with certain civs, like germany, and under certain game settings (like epic speed, where you get more barb camps, longer unit construction times, and higher probability of mega-promoted units). i think we can all agree liberty or tradition is going to be optimal for all games unless you are using mods or cbp. but sometimes its fun to try different playstyles. you are right that tradition, then opening honor, works, but it results in your not getting the benefit of the honor opener for at least 2 eras. which is the time when barb camps are the most plentiful and have the widest spawn points. by the time you fill tradition, you and the other civs probably have 3-4 cities up, and as a result barb camps are much less common."
subject100,0," - definitely polynesia, but second-favorite is probably venice. you are smack-dab in the middle of lots of civs, so you will have plenty of caravan/cargo ship destinations, plenty of xp fodder in wars when someone inevitably attacks you, pretty decent natural defenses (water and mountain ranges), and since you can't build settlers, you don't feel the crunch of a really crowded europe in the same way that other civs do."
subject100,0," - did you wipe out any other civs? that might be why everyone declared war on you. the game is definitely salvageable if you can get your happiness up. if you are close to unlocking coal/factories, i'd focus on getting an ideology, which i find the easiest way to get a quick happiness boost."
subject100,0," - your warmonger penalties go waaaay up if you completely eliminate a civ. so its best to take an ai's capital, and maybe his best city (to raze it), and then leave him with 1 or 2 crappy little 5 pop cities. then pay someone else to finish the job, and let that person get the world's ire."
subject100,0," - -yes, natural wonders can spawn close to players, but it is very, very rare that a natural wonder will be visible from your starting location. you can game this a bit by playing certain civs with tsl (true starting location maps). -getting to the next era reduces the tech costs of all techs in the previous era by a small percent. -no, you don't need more faith per turn (meaning faith ruins/meeting religious cses can get you a gp). the gp counter is based on total faith. however, you still should be producing faith, because if another civ pops its prophet (and makes a religion), the counter could go up higher than your current faith. -there's no one answer: it depends a lot on each map, but don't forget that luxuries will dictate that your city get settled at least somewhat close to them. i will say ""mountain one tile away"" is rarely something i care about, since i think it affects maybe 2 wonders? -i'll build hydro plants even with one river tile, because that production is multiplied by all of your +production multipliers, like a factory. -i find temple of artemis pretty easy to get, because few ai go tradition. -i prioritize gses always, because venice late game science can slow down alot due to low total pop. but i also try to get colossus or great lighthouse, which give gmov points. so usually with one gmov from optics, and a few gmovs from my wonder, i'll get the 3-4 gmovs i need to get the cses i want. -no re: forbidden palace, because a city with a courthouse is still occupied. -50% each. -no clue."
subject100,0," - on the steam workshop if you search 'giant,' there are a few earth-based ones (earth, asia, africa). i've never heard of a giant random map though, or giant 'other' civ maps, like pangea."

subject100,0," - i love venice + the ideology trait that gives you influence with every cs you have a trade route to. by end-game, you have 20 free cs allies."
subject100,0," - 1. they might be playing lower levels. you get more base happiness at lower levels. 2. ideologies + religion. each ideology has several +happiness tenets, meaning you can build a wide empire and each city has the right buildings, you can produce a ton of happiness. similarly, if you develop a religion with buildings as beliefs, you can get lots of +happiness in each city. 3. mods. lots of screenshots won't mention all the mods in use. lots of modded civs, the cbp, and other mods can result in way more happiness than you'd regularly expect. 4. your own happiness might be dragged down by the effects of ideological influence. in larger games, several large, high tourism neighbors can great upwards of 50 unhappiness points if you have differing ideologies."
subject100,0," - crusader kings ii especially. its one thing to throw people into the deep end. ckii blindfolds you, sails you to the middle of the ocean, breaks your legs and throws you overboard."
subject100,0," - edit -no clue why everything is bold. #2 isn't quite right. your social policy costs are based on 'the most cities you've ever held at once.' so if you have 3 cities, and conquer a city, your social policy costs are now the costs if you have 4 cities. even if you immediately raze city 4, the counter doesn't go down. however! if you raze city 4 completely, and then next turn take city 5, your city counter is still only 4. so its really not a downside of razing during domination. its more a downside of razing a bunch of cities you get in a peace deal. more razing! its the best!"
subject100,0," - agreed. and if the forward-settling civ is an enemy, you can park some infantry at the city's gates to get some free xp from bombardment. or have your ranged units use it for target practice. a 3 pop city isn't going to hurt infantry."
subject100,0," - i think its the same as culture. your science is based on your highest 'most cities at one time.' so the first city you capture and raze ups your counter. but if you capture and raze a second city once the first one is ashes, your counter doesn't change."
subject100,0," - the 30 days is ""30 turns."" so if you trade for 4 uranium, you get that uranium for 30 turns, then you need to renew the trade agreement. people get more by trading for it, allying with city-states that have uranium, and by taking certain policies (i know autocracy has a 'double strategic resources' policy). as a larger point, i don't see too many people with dozens and dozens of missiles in regular games unless its a domination game and they've conquered most of the map. and really, you only need a couple uranium. you build a nuke, you use it, and you get that uranium back. it doesn't disappear forever despite being in a bomb."
subject100,0, - i think the units using the uranium fight with a combat penalty. i don't recall exactly how large it is. might be 50%?
subject100,0, - thank you!
subject100,0," - i love this idea. that was one of my favorite parts of spore (ok, probably my only favorite part). i think it would be fun if you could 'import' a civ v save via science victory to beyond earth, and depending on how your game progressed, you get certain bonuses. similarly, if you were at war/enemies with certain civs, you start as enemies with certain be factions. it wouldn't line up perfectly, but it would be cool to tinker with."
subject100,0," - your city has no production, so the building will never be built. civ rev 2 is a tough way to learn civ mechanics, because there isn't much in the way of explanation, and the developers (i think) assumed at least some prior civ experience. very generally, in civ, certain tiles produce units of 'production' (i.e., those little hammers). each building costs x number of hammers. so if you have 2 hammers, and the library costs 40 hammers, your city needs 20 turns to build it. if you look at the top of your screen, you have 8 science, 2 food, and no hammers. and none of the tiles around the cities have a hammer icon. i don't remember the exact civrev2 mechanics (i only played it for a few games then got bored of it - don't let its crappiness dissuade you from real civ games), but i think you can eventually get some production by buying buildings that grant production on plains or grasslands? but in the meantime, this city isn't going to do too well."
subject100,0," - there is a mod called extended eras on the steam workshop. so the game pace slows down (meaning slow research), but the buildings/units are built at the same speed as you would get on the faster speeds."
subject100,0, - i've been enjoying dan carlin's hardcore history podcasts. something fun about playing as the mongols while listening to the rise of genghis khan.
subject100,0," - as mentioned below, the replayability is much lower. so i was a bit annoyed when i bought it at full price. but if i was getting be for less than $10, i probably wouldn't have minded as much. it was a fun game for the few playthroughs i completed, though."
subject100,0," - agreed on your summary of embassies. i think unless you are playing deity, its preferable to share embassies with ais. then you have info about their cities, their expected expansions, the general layout of the continent, etc. sharing your capital location can get you in trouble, but for all difficulties except deity, i think a backstab during the classical era is actually beneficial, since it gets your troops some xp and it really sets your neighbor back, since he just threw 15+ units into your meatgrinder defense."
subject100,0," - one piece of advice is to never completely wipe out an enemy. take his capital, take or raze his second best city, but otherwise leave him alive and crippled. if you wipe him out entirely, every ai you have met will hate you for a very long time."
subject100,0," - you don't need great works if you are heavily science focused, as the minor culture that they provide won't do too much to turn the tides against other civ influences. i think hinanai's advice below is good, as i rarely 'save' my gw/gas. however, if you spawn a great writer, keep an eye on a few key events, such as the world's fair or a golden age. if you earn a great writer and one of these events is coming up (or some other event that otherwise boosts your culture), its best to wait, since the great writer culture value is based on the previous 8 turns of culture produced by your civ. so if you just won the world's fair and then wait 8 turns, the value of that gw just went up a ton. similarly, if you spawn a ga and you know in 10 turns you will be going to war, or the world's fair is coming up, or you are just about to finish researching plastics (and so you can build research labs), it might make sense to wait a few turns before creating that golden age, so that your empire can make the best use of the productivity and gold boost."
subject100,0," - debatable, but generally people love poland, babylon, and korea. poland's social policies are very valuable, and babylon/korea are the best at science, and science = winning in civ v. the shoshone are pretty strong, and england is also well-regarded (though less so if you play pangea)."
subject100,0," - if i'm playing passive, my go-to method is one ranged unit in each city, and 1-2 units roaming around my empire, keeping trade routes safe. i usually go tradition, so the ranged units are free. that helps quite a bit. i also keep up a bit of gold reserve equal to 1 or 2 military units. therefore, if i get stabbed in the back, i can rush-buy some defenders. the roaming units are also helpful for scouting purposes. if you get backstabbed, you should know about it well in advance. typically the ai will send its 10+ unit army on a rather convoluted march, and won't declare war until actually at your borders. if you see more than 1 enemy unit moving together towards you, chances are war is coming. lastly, the trade screen is very helpful in ferreting out potential backstabs. if you hover over the leader's status towards you, it might say 'friendly,' but the hover text shows ""covets your lands"" or ""covets your wonders."" well, in that case, keep a unit in between him and you, so you see the army coming."
subject100,0," - all of the 'early' game buildings (aka buildings from the first few eras) are useful, so definitely focus on getting those built. once the later eras roll around though, i find that some cities don't need all of the buildings (non-capitals rarely need constabularies or caravanasaries, for instance, except for national wonders), and you need to balance your gold per turn (since these buildings cost maintenance) with their usefulness."
subject100,0," - marbozir, quill18 and filthyrobot have some good youtube videos."
subject100,0," - i like the current promotion system much more than your proposal. yours is definitely more realistic, but way less enjoyable. take your forest example. so how does that work? do i have to win x forest battles to trigger a 'forest promotion'? say its: kill 3 units in a forest. great, i got 2 kills in the forest, but now i'm stuck arranging this unit so he can get one more kill in a forest, even though i've pushed through the enemy's lines and its mostly plains around his city. not only does the proposed system suffer for individual promotions, but now you've created a system of promotions where, chances are, your promotions don't help the type of war you wage. great, my infantry have +forest attack bonuses, but i use infantry to sop up city bombardment during sieges (and so i typically beeline to cover promotions). so promotions don't make my units any stronger, because i don't use them that way (and frankly the game combat mechanics aren't so fluid that i could 'make it work') unless i park a warrior outside a barb camp and let myself be target practice while i farm up my cover promotions. not realistic at all. and then on the rare occasion where a promotion is useful, it now feels like an rng element that i (or the ai) lucked into. i like to think of experience not as ""you fought well in one scenario, so now you are better in that specific scenario - like forests."" instead i think of it as ""you fought well and survived, and now that general awareness and practice has made you better in the following ways, which you trained at."""
subject100,0," - on top of this, a green apple. which is way less 'recognizable' than a red apple. i get that green = growth, so that might be a more helpful association, but when i think of apples, i think red."
subject100,0," - rule 1. never send out a settler alone. you should have a warrior to escort him. it sounds like you are having a bit of trouble in the early eras. what buildings are you building? what does your military look like? how far away are you settling new cities? its not uncommon to be at zero, or slightly negative gpt for the first 2 eras, until you unlock markets. you can easily offset this loss of gpt by selling strategic luxuries (horses, iron) to ai, selling extra copies of luxuries to ais, or by clearing barb camps. remember, if you are at -1gpt, and clear 1 barb camp, well you are revenue-neutral for the next 75 turns! another question: what does your army look like? i'll maybe have 1 additional warrior, on top of my starting warrior, but otherwise i'm building archers. archers clear barbs faster, since they don't take damage when they attack, and archers are generally better at killing invading armies. so you'll need fewer archers, and therefore you spend less gpt on maintenance."
subject100,0," - if you scroll over each civ's score in the diplomacy screen, it is a component of 5 or so sub-scores. the 'technology' score is based on the number of techs researched."
subject100,0," - trading posts on jungles is still a good idea. trading posts on forests can be okay, assuming that if you removed the forest, you wouldn't have a good farm underneath (ie, with fresh water access)."
subject100,0," - right when trading posts are researched, they are definitely crap. but after economics and finishing either commerce or rationalism, they aren't terrible. definitely not good enough to justify how much the ai loves them, though."
subject100,0," - i get what you're saying, and you're right that finishing commerce has its costs, but i think entrepreneurship's detriment is a bit overstated. its by no means great, but it does open up the +2 happiness for luxuries, which can be a meaningful +10 happiness boost at a minimum (realistically much more). 25% faster gm points can be easily overcome if you pay attention to your specialists. if you don't work any banks/markets, your base gm point accrual is zero. so you are getting 25% more gm points from wonders, which is maybe 3-4 wonders if you got lucky and/or are in the lead. it definitely sucks to maybe lose out on a great scientist from popping at least one gm, but i'd be genuinely surprised if the policy cost you more than 1 gs over the course of the game."
subject100,0," - in terms of build order, most people build a scout first (or possibly 2 scouts). so i'd recommend that change first. scouting has some key advantages: 1. it helps you find the best new city locations, 2. meeting city states gives you gold, 3. meeting ais reduces tech costs, and 4. you can find more ancient ruins. generally, if you play tradition, you want to completely fill out the tradition tree before putting points in another tree. same with liberty. both trees are full of great policies, so there's no point not finishing the tree. think: if you finish a tree, you get the bonus ""policy,"" so you are getting 7 policies for the price of 6. archers do take longer to build, but as i mentioned, they are much sturdier. also, if a worker gets stolen, steal it back! the barbarian takes the worker back to its camp. if you go to the camp, you get to: 1. get xp from killing the barbs, 2. get gold for clearing the camp, and 3. get your free worker back. generally you want cities 6 tiles apart at least, so you're good there. a general point on workers. you don't need to immediately build improvements around all of your cities. its helpful, but its expensive. and you can only work the number of tiles around your city as you have citizens in that city. so if you have a 4 pop city, don't waste time building 3 workers for that city. you only need 4 improvements until the city grows. typically 1 worker per city should be plenty, and maybe go up to 2 if you have lots of forests to chop, or something similar. if you limit your number of workers to 1-2 per city, if barbarians show up, you can hide one worker in the city, and the other worker can hide around the city, keeping the city between the barbarian and the worker. it sucks to have things pillaged. but it takes way more time to rebuild a worker than it does to repair a pillaged improvement. lastly, it seems like barbarians are really giving you a hard time. its not the worst idea to disable barbarians for a few games while you understand the rest of the mechanics of the game. then, once you understand how you should be using your military units and what buildings to prioritize, turn them back on."
subject100,0," - spain on a large/huge terra map with raging barbs can be lots of fun (especially if you pre-select all ais so that you don't have polynesia). there are so many barbs in the new world by the time astronomy rolls around that the ai struggles to keep its settlers alive, whereas a squad of conquistadors can not only clear out a patch of turf, but then can also settle the best locations. obviously not an optimal game, because you end up settling a bunch of cities mid-game, but its a fun exercise in empire-building."
subject100,0," - amen to your point about marathon. ""you found a national wonder, here's less than 50% of the gold you need for a settler."""
subject100,0," - its marginally cheesier than doing this with archers, and the only difference is that it is a bit easier (less squishy units, so less concern of bombardment death). but its the same end result, since archers/comp bowmen/crossbowmen with range+logistics are basically unstoppable killing machines. so if you're okay with doing this with archers, i don't see why doing it with archers formerly known as scouts is all that much worse."
subject100,0," - i think its as cheesy as stealing a cs worker, or trading all of your luxuries for lump-sum gold to an ai then immediately declaring war. but everyone has a different definition of cheesy. i'm not saying that's a your plan is a bad thing, though. you can play the game however you want, and if the game is more fun for you if you spend 30 turns farming free xp so that you have a super-strong battalion of archers, the more power to you. its not like the ai doesn't get its fair share of bs bonuses."
subject100,0," - agreed that its different, and the scout-archers are really unkillable and more powerful. i just don't think its that different from a fundamental 'is it cheesy' standpoint, because scout-archers with all promotions or archers with range-logistics, it doesn't really matter. you can still conquer your continent with ease, and the ai really doesn't have a chance."
subject100,0," - running off steam macs mod use much, much easier, since you can just subscribe to steam workshop mods rather than having to install anything."
subject100,0," - this. no idea why the rest of the thread has fighting barbs as an all-or-nothing ""fight until one of you dies"" or ""leave and wait for several units."""
subject100,0," - i would not like this as a victory condition, for two reasons. first, in beyond earth, there are a few victory conditions where you win by building a wonder, then building a bunch of units. its not fun. at all. i realize your description isn't just ""build a ton of units,"" but it does seem like a large component of what constitutes 'military power.' and i wouldn't want a part of the game to just be 'fill up all your tiles with units.' the second, and i think bigger reason, is that you take the ability to prevent a victory from the player's hands. currently, the ai can't beat me in a domination game if i hold my capital. i think one of the weakest points of the civ victory conditions (diplo, science and cultural), is that to some extent, you can be playing well, and in an unexplored corner of the world, some other ai wins without you either knowing or having much chance to counter. at least with diplo and culture, you get a heads-up when someone is aiming for these victory conditions, and you can actively work against them. similarly, you know when someone is getting ahead in tech, and can take actions to slow them down. i think the better fix is to just stop playing when you've 'won.' sometimes i play domination on a huge map, and when i've conquered half the map and am getting bored, there's nothing stopping me from starting a new game. getting that 'victory' screen isn't so satisfying that i'm going to spend hours getting there. sure, i might not get achievements or see my final score, but really, who cares about that stuff?"
subject100,0," - i like them for the realism. otherwise early game has a lot less strategy. plus, this game has enough 'mix-max' built in ""research x first, rush building y next, etc. etc."" i like that barbs can force you to revise your strategy a bit."
subject100,0," - cavalry on the flanks. ai (and players) put artillery in the back, and rightly so. send your cavalry the long way around, and hit them in the back. 2 knights can do quite a bit of damage and then run away. the artillery can either fire back with weakened damage (since it is  gt;50% health) or it can try to run away or heal (both of which will be futile, since next turn you can get right back on top of them)."
subject100,0," - thanks. yep, a typo. i actually didn't know 'mix-max'ing was a thing. i'd heard of 'mix-and-match.'"
subject100,0," - there should be debuffs, though. there needs to be diplomatic trade-offs for waging a war. your system makes domination too easy. if you have options that let you take a city without weakening your empire or pissing off the rest of the world, why wouldn't you just always be at war?"
subject100,0," - in the diplomacy tab, one of the sub-tabs lists all the civs, their social policies, their wonders, and their current political deals."
subject100,0," - egypt is a good civ. not the best, but they have a nice ub (unique building) and their ua helps a ton with early wonders. their ub makes liberty a bit easier than other civs, but either liberty or tradition work well with them. depends on if you want to go wide or tall."
subject100,0," - i always thought it was playing to build up a pretty empire, with lots of infrastructure and extra unnecessary cities, rather than pursuing a specific victory condition and winning as quickly as possible. usually its coupled with playing on a few levels of difficulty below what you can usually handle."
subject100,0, - they are very similar to arabian days.
subject100,0," - i think eui (enhanced user interface) is plenty. it doesn't change gameplay, it just provides more information that is otherwise difficult to figure out in civ's un-modded menus."
subject100,0," - i love having the chance to fully colonize australia before the rest of the world has a chance. i then like to pretend i'm playing risk, where i start in australia (+2 armies per turn!) and slowly push out to take over the world!"
subject100,0, - i haven't seen anything like that. best i could recommend would be to cut and paste carl's guide (link in the sub-reddit sidebar) to a word file.
subject100,0," - the bonuses aren't terribly important, and the short-term costs (production spent building shrines/temples, gold spent on building upkeep) and the long-term costs (spending faith on missionaries/prophets instead of saving them for late-game great scientists) usually don't outweigh the brief benefits you get from having a religion that quickly gets overwhelmed by ai missionary spam."
subject100,0," - no way you can call them worst in a world where the iroquis exist, unless you're specifically talking mp. not having to spend resources on settlers in the first few eras is huge, meaning its easier to get a few early wonders that would otherwise set your infrastructure back if you were playing as another civ. they have a science/culture penalty, but they make up for it by being able to get national college and a few other key national wonders much earlier and for much less production, because you only need the underlying building in the capital. you're right that gold-hammers is poor, but you rarely, if ever, need to utilize that. you should either be hard-building wonders in your capital, or you should be building units for domination or gifting for influence. and lastly, people forget that cses usually have good terrain for their cities. so when you're picking cses to puppet, chances are you'll be getting a few unique luxuries, or some key strategic resources. which is more than your typical hard-settled 4th+ city gets you."
subject100,0," - i typically use them for the treatise. if you time it right, it can be close to a free policy. hold the gw until 8 turns after you win world's fair (double culture), or 8 turns after you pop a golden age to get even more culture."
subject100,0," - there is a mod called 'events and decisions,' by jfd. if you run some searches on this sub-reddit, you'll see lots of screenshots/discussions. its quite a popular mod and looks very cool (i haven't personally used it)."
subject100,0," - there is no mac version sadly, fellow mac user. i believe it has to do with the mod revising "".dll"" files, which is a windows only thing, meaning it also doesn't work on linux. so you'd need to get something like bootcamp and swap oses each time you want to play civ."
subject100,0, - the amount of culture produced by a great writer (as well as the amount of science produced by a great scientist) is calculated as the sum of your civ's culture from the previous 8 turns (on standard speed).
subject100,0, - definitely if its on sale.
subject100,0," - the ua amounts to a free social policy tree, which is incredibly valuable. further, the timing of the free policies is quite nice; for instance, you can open rationalism the turn after it is available. the unique unit turns a crummy unit (the lancer) into a unit actually useful (since it pushes enemy units away upon attack). the unique building is solid, and has good synergy with the unique unit. poland lets you pursue any victory strategy, so you don't have to worry about what your starting territory is. landlocked england - not as good; babylon next to 2 warmongers - could be trouble; incas without mountains - not going to maximize growth. for pretty much every other civ, you can envision a scenario where its hard to make use of what that civ does best. for poland, you never have to worry about that."
subject100,0," - amen. it doesn't come off as a great ability if you just crunch numbers, but it is such an advantage in the right situation."
subject100,0," - turn on quick movement and quick combat. that helps me a ton (running a 2010 macbook pro). if it gets really bad in later eras, before you end your turn, switch from normal view to strategic view. i find that when i get really laggy is when there are tons of airplanes and naval units for the ai to move. strategic view helps avoid that issue."
subject100,0," - ""only to be crushed."" pfft. check your history. usa! usa! usa!"
subject100,0," - chop down the forests to get production to get your basic buildings up (monument, granary, market), then build farms/trade posts everywhere. once your borders expand north, you'll have some decent tiles for river farms. this city won't be a powerhouse, but if you focus on getting gold (to get multipliers on the wonder) and science buildings, at least the city won't drag you down."
subject100,0," - not sure how to manually do this, but you can download mods with true starting location (tsl) on the steam workshop. check out ynaemp (yet not another earth map pack) and tsl africa for some popular options."
subject100,0," - i'll weigh in best i can, with the caveat that each game is a little different. geography/map type, neighbors, difficulty all matter. i'm assuming you aren't playing deity. i found 2-3 cities, under the assumption that i will be taking a 4th within the first few eras. this can vary though; if i only really have 1 good location (where i start), and my map area is crowded, i might only settle one other city (mainly to ensure internal trade routes for food). i almost never keep non-capitals, unless they provide some amazing wonders (e.g., a great petra city, or a gbr city) or have an important strategic value (e.g., it is the first city on a new continent, and i'd rather build units there than sail my reinforcements around the world). for buildings, i always grab science buildings. falling behind in science can just be too much to overcome. i generally prioritize gold over food/production, but that also depends on my city. if i am in hills, and my luxuries are mine-based, then i will forgo production for food; alternatively, if i'm on plains surrounded by wheat, i will wait a bit on my granary. barracks can actually wait (though not for zulus, due to ikanda), since i'd much rather have 2-3 more units in my army than have a free promotion. if i'm warring frequently and correctly, i'm not losing many units, and i'm grinding down the ai so much that i'm getting all the good promotions early anyways. i almost never use siege units until artillery. they're too slow and too squishy. i find that i can protect an archer or 2 long enough that they get range/logistics, and with melee units as meat-shields/fog-of-war removers, i can use archers to blow up cities. i usually like more archers than melee, but for the impis, i might push that ratio closer to 1:1, since impis are so strong, and they synergize so well. further, if i'm going honor, i'll keep more melee around, since the social policies benefit this. honor can work, depending on the map, and your war techniques. to work, you need lots of enemies (because you fund your army in part with the honor finisher), so on lower difficulties, its hard to be effective, because the ai sucks at production and you win wars so fast that you don't have time to farm gold. there's lots of theorycrafting on the tradition opener if you go liberty. i find that its probably an okay move, but i only get it after i'm 4/5 into liberty. i want citizenship and i want the free settler, so if i'm going liberty, i'm making sure i get those policies asap. pacing also varies. i generally like to start asap and just keep rolling until something gets in my way. building up an army, then having it sit around for a few eras, seems like a waste of gold to me. there's also the benefit (on some maps, like large islands or small continents) of wiping out all of your neighbors to avoid warmonger penalties with unmet ais; of course, you can't do that on pangea. but geography matters. if you are in the middle of pangea, you better be careful going all-out on war, because you might soon be facing invasions from 4 sides. so in that case, you need to grab an early capital; hang out for a bit; play the diplomacy game and get your next target denounced, etc. i find my domination games generally go 2 paths: 1. i play relatively passive (trad or lib - maybe take 1 neighbor's capital), keep pace in science and pull ahead in science around artillery. then use artillery and planes to wash over the globe. 2. i go all-in at the outset. i take a capital with 2-3 warriors and 3 archers. those archers get range/logistics in the process; my warriors get +3 cover promotions, and we just march from city to city, burning everything to the ground, using gold from conquests to upgrade my units. i've won the game before artillery, or at least i own such a huge swath of land and enough capitals that i am way ahead. this strategy is a bit tougher, and can really get bungled if your early neighbors share luxuries with you (making happiness nearly impossible)."
subject100,0," - agreed 100%. the worst part of be is that you pick a civ (that has 1 unique trait), then you make 5ish other selections about your start (will you start with a free warrior or free worker, for example). the problem is that it is impossible to balance all of these different decisions, so there quickly become 2 or 3 optimal choices. sure, every game 'could' be different, but the reality is that you take the best choice each time. i'm much more confident that developers can balance 1 set of inputs (the ua, ub and uu) from the game's outset, because for all the talk of ""op civ!,"" most of the civs are pretty balanced, and 2 of the 3 best civs (korea and babylon) are only op in the player's hands, because the ai doesn't utilize science/specialists especially well."
subject100,0," - can you really envision the ai making good choices about which personalities to take? i can't. just seems like another way for the human player to quickly trounce the ai, meaning the ai needs even sillier starting bonuses to make the game a challenge."
subject100,0," - venice domination is fun. you have the mini-game of keeping your trade routes unplundered. you buy units in your capital and use production to wonder-whore. especially fun on pangea or large continents. polynesia as terra. take initial settler and warrior, and on turn 1 sail to the new world. fall behind early on while relocating, but build up an entire continent by yourself. works best on epic/marathon speeds. attila/genghis/zulu on a non-round map (so grasslands, for eg). just go full warmonger right off the bat. have 2 armies - 1 to push against enemies and burn down the world, 1 to hold off the inevitable denunciation/war from every remaining ai. byzantine on emperor. re-roll starts until you get desert folklore. go nuts with getting an early religion. take the 3 religious buildings as your beliefs. spam infinite cities across the map."
subject100,0," - exactly. it makes it very easy to win, once you realize certain synergies (like maxing out your health bonuses to spam cities, to spam trade routes). and those synergies are just too hard for a few developers to anticipate with limited play-testing. then we end up in another round of ""don't buy vanilla, its buggy and sucks; civ vi is garbage compared to civ v + dlcs + 5 years of modding community."" i think there are much better things they could spend development resources on. i hope they do some form of the be quest system (with fewer quests), because it is a nice mechanic to help overcome the issues that can make some civ games very difficult (eg, struggling with production during a plains start). but every building shouldn't trigger a decision."
subject100,0," - i think the extra luxuries mod helps a bit, but admittedly its been awhile."
subject100,0," - great points by throwaway. to add more color: improve your luxuries first. for your early cities, you probably want to improve your food tiles first (meaning wheat farms, pastures, camps), since you will grow faster, meaning you will have more tiles to work. once you're set on building improvements equal to the number of citizens you have, start building roads to your other cities, to gain city connections."
subject100,0," - one nice part of civ revolutions 2 was that each ship had a 'militia' unit. it was basically worthless under any actual attack. but it could dis-embark from the ship and explore ruins (or to apply to civ v, clear barb camps), or it could explore a slightly larger island that your ship can't get full line of sight on. i think this would be a really nice addition to civ vi to break up some of the frustrating (but not game-breaking) situations that arise in island maps."
subject100,0," - interesting. i think i'm the opposite. if i have wet wheat, then i figure the city can handle some decent early growth (say to 4 pop) by itself, and be otherwise self-supportive enough. whereas if it is garbage tiles that i'm probably settling for luxuries/strategic purposes, i sent a worker over asap since the improvements will be necessary for making the city useful."
subject100,0," - that is way more workers than is usually recommended, and it assumes you're going to war right away. hardly a rule of thumb. i can't imagine having enough population in my second city to justify 3 workers. you end up improving more tiles than you have citizens capable of working them."
subject100,0," - true, but you're not making the decision in a vacuum. for the sake of this discussion, you're giving up production in your capital to make sure you have a worker ready asap for that new city. i'm often torn between the decision of ""make an extra worker,"" ""build my granary,"" or ""build a caravan for internal trade routes."" especially when you assume that you just hard-built a settler, meaning you cost your capital x turns of growth, sometimes i'm going to hold off on building that worker for city #3. i think its a different discussion if you are stealing workers, or if you already have a worker built, and its a question of keeping that worker in your capital to improve your 6th tile, or sending him with your settler. i also play on slower gameplay settings (epic/marathon), so the worker decisions are skewed a bit by taking 20ish turns to complete an improvement, and 20ish turns to build a worker."
subject100,0, - and did you win the fight?
subject100,0," - interesting look into mp worker management. i only play sp, so i appreciate your summary of how things are different."
subject100,0," - many of them are almost completely new games (like the fall of rome scenario) becuase the victory conditions and mechanics are so different from the base game. so i recommend playing the scenarios on a slightly lower difficulty until you get the hang of the mechanics, and to figure out what the ai does."
subject100,0, - i wish i could vote this up more than once...
subject100,0," - the amount of research/culture provided by a gw/gs is calculated as the sum of the previous 8 turns (on standard speed) of culture/science produced by your civ. so if you earn a gs on turn 1 (impossible), but wait until turn 200, you'd get the science produced in turns 192-199. that's why its a good idea to hold gws until 8 turns into a golden age, or 8 turns after winning world's fair (or both)."
subject100,0, - wait for a steam sale.
subject100,0," - not generally, no. each city you settle increases the science you need to research each tech, and increases the culture you need to get your next social policy. so you only want to settle cities that will be worthwhile contributors to your empire. if you play tradition, you generally settle 4 cities. if you play liberty, you generally settle 5-8 cities. the number of cities can vary on what your strategy is, but you need to remember that the goal of the game is not to cover the whole world in your color, but to achieve the victory conditions."
subject100,0," - i'd be for it if it didn't retain its original ownership, or somehow had severely limited production for several turns. seems like i'd hardly ever want to leave a functioning city (and more importantly a functioning city bombardment opportunity) at my army's back. it would be cool if sacking a city either wiped out its production/military buildings (which would be historically accurate) or if the sacked city reverted to 'unclaimed' status, where anyone could swoop in and take it under 'protection.'"
subject100,0," - hard to say 'best,' because the best civs on regular speed are still the best civs overall (poland/korea/babylon). but 'best' in terms of gets the best boost from standard to marathon? songhai if you play with barbs on a large map. marathon gold production is amazingly slow, and rush-buy costs are hard to come by. imagine 3 gpt and a settler costs 1100 gold. not going to rush-buy any time soon. well if you clear a few barb camps with songhai, you will be swimming in gold. one of the few times the honor opener is hands-down the optimum path. celts as mentioned below are another one. since you spend 50+ turns before you even consider chopping forests, you get tons of faith right off the bat."
subject100,0," - play marathon/huge with raging barbs, and open honor. you will be swimming in gold while your opponents struggle to keep settlers alive. you can rush buy every building in your city while you go super-wide pumping out settlers, or go super-tall and wonderwhoring. your gpt won't be amazing, but your dedicated barbarian hunter special forces (2 ranged and a melee) will keep your coffers full. play with unlimited barbarian xp for even more fun!"
subject100,0," - absolutely right that raging barbs doesn't increase the number of camps. but consider 2 benefits to 'raging' barbs: 1. the ai is much worse than the human at handling barbs. so raging barbs means the ai expands more slowly, meaning that more of the map stays in the fog of war, meaning that there are more opportunities for camps to pop. 2. camps generally have more barbs surrounding them in raging barbs, meaning it is harder to clear the camp. again, the ai is lousy at dealing with barbs (and with healing their units). so raging barbs means its much easier for your strike force of 2-3 units to snipe camps that the ai otherwise would have cleared if the camp just had 1 barb unit there. so in theory raging barbs should mean you clearing fewer camps, the reality (at least what i have experienced) is that you end up clearing a higher percentage of total camps cleared."
subject100,0," - i really didn't like civ rev 2. i found the games either brain-numbingly easy on the lower difficulties, or impossibly unfun on the hardest difficulty. and unlike civ v, where you have tons of resources explaining the math/strategy needed to overcome the ai bonuses, there's absolutely nothing. the civopedia or whatever on civ rev 2 is a joke, and there is nothing in the way of a community resource. coupled with the fact that its not free (i think it was close to $10usd when i bought it), i would not recommend it."
subject100,0," - a lot of good info in this thread, but don't forget about production multipliers. factories, forges, windmills, etc. all boost the +1 prod from stables (for instance) to much larger numbers. if i'm going 4-city tall, even with only 1 instance of the tile, i'm probably building the building."
subject100,0," - you might just want to use the 'no happiness mod,' or other similar mods."
subject100,0," - definitely true, and build order is important. i don't think the multipliers justify building the stables before any science or food buildings, and i typically prefer gold buildings before it as well. and at the end of the day, everything in civ is a question of trade-offs and priorities. if you have 5 ai swordsmen outside your capital and just unlocked philosophy, you probably aren't building nc before you make some defensive units. i was mainly just saying that the ""building costs x hammers, so only build it if you have y turns to get your value,"" isn't going to give you the right answer all the time."
subject100,0, - i'm pretty sure you need a mod.
subject100,0," - basic idea for surviving on defense: build 2 archers and 1 warrior. this is your base military 'unit.' your warrior stands between the enemy and your archers, preferably on a friendly type of terrain (like on top of a hill, behind a river, in the forests). your archers stand one unit behind your warrior. the enemy attacks your warrior. your warrior spends its turn healing, your archers spend their turns shooting the nearest ai. build x number of these 3-team units depending on how many units your enemy has. if you are in danger of being overrun, retreat your units back to your territory, where your units heal double. you're right that science ultimately dictates military success. each era, prioritize researching the tech that lets you build a new science building. then build that science building in every city."
subject100,0," - horse/armor units are great for taking cities, and for pillaging the countryside. they're also good for flanking, and good for providing line-of-sight/scounting. since most people use the basic structure of melee in the front, ranged in the back, you can use cavalry to run past the melee units, and attack the ranged units directly, or to get a sense of the number/type of units hidden in the fog of war. i can't speak much to pvp, since i don't play multiplayer, but i'd assume a cavalry unit or two would be helpful."
subject100,0," - be is fun, and runs about as well as civ v on my low end laptop. i'd get your full value out of civ 5 first, though. 36 hours and you haven't even touched the surface. be is on sale pretty frequently, so if you don't get it now, it will be there during the next steam sale."
subject100,0," - you wouldn't be able to. you didn't mention that as a goal in your original post, so i'd recommend one of the op modded civs recommended elsewhere."
subject100,0, - sid meier does.
subject100,0," - ""multi-kill!"""
subject100,0, - dominating!
subject100,0," - it does not increase the spawn rate of camps. i believe it does increase the spawn rate of barbarians from camps, though. so you end up with more aggressive barbarians, because you have more barbarians leaving the nest and roaming around, so to speak."
subject100,0," - i mentioned this in another thread, but i disagree. the ai sucks at dealing with barbs, so raging barbs = fewer camps cleared by the ai = more camps for you to steal. a decent human player shouldn't be affected by having to kill 2 axemen instead of 1, so at worst your archer needs another 3 turns in between kills; whereas an ai might as well offer his capital in a peace deal to 2 axemen."
subject100,0," - another point to consider is that more barbs (and therefore barb camps) restrict how quickly the ai can settle. if the ai expands more slowly, then the fog of war is larger, and then there are more locations where barbs can spawn = more camps for you to clear."
subject100,0, - the communitas map mod i think spawns better offshore islands.
subject100,0," - in some respects, its actually easier as a learning civ. since you can spend the game not worrying about when to build settlers (and in turn having to juggle happiness), you can focus more on understanding the effects of certain buildings and units on early-game infrastructure."
subject100,0," - definitely not crap. not as good a civ v, but holding it to the standard of ""i need to get 1,000 hours of gameplay out of a game,"" is unreasonable. i recently got rising tide on a steam sale, and i've been enjoying the aquatic cities mechanic. honestly, i expect to play a few games using aquatic cities, play a few games as the new factions, then probably go back to civ v. but that doesn't mean its crap. the only argument i have that its crap is that i find the color scheme really offputting, but that's subjective."
subject100,0, - bombs built in this city have a 33% chance of launch failure.
subject100,0," - its a ton of free early culture. i wouldn't call it op, but given that most of the other sponsor uas are pretty useless, even having a moderately good ua like au can feel 'op.'"
subject100,0," - i think it makes sense. i think you'd be hard-pressed to have a balanced game on quick/huge, for instance. certain victory conditions would be impossible (e.g., domination and cultural) due to map size constraints."
subject100,0," - this is similar to how units work in beyond earth. every affinity level (which is a measurement of progress and you 'level up' by quests or researching certain techs), you can upgrade one type of your unit, and you end up upgrading them 3 times each. it is an interesting mechanic, but i find there to be a pretty big downside: the learning curve of remember what each unit does/why each unit is special is pretty tough. its easy to remember your own unit's beneficial ability, because you spend a bit of time thinking about the decision you make. but i often forget what the other unit sub-types have as unique traits. 9 times out of 10, it doesn't really matter. but there are some times where you're trying to plan a few moves ahead, and it can be hard because sometimes you forget that the invading enemy has +50% to city damage, or something like that, and the city you thought could hold out 4 turns falls in 3. i think civ vi could overcome most of this problem with (a) better hover-over info displays and (b) better graphics/icons."
subject100,0," - well, if your happiness is limiting your growth early game, its not a bad idea to take that opportunity to build your national college. then, once nc is built, resume your expansion."
subject100,0," - i like it on huge/marathon, but with an extra luxuries mod, so that the new world feels useful."
subject100,0," - very true. but you can take other steps during the library/nc building, like improving luxuries, developing a religion, researching techs with happiness buildings like the circus/coliseum. i don't have a hard-and-fast rule of ""cap each city at x"" pop, because the decision depends too much on other factors, like luxuries, the race to settle key locations, what your religion looks like, etc. if you want to get a feel for how to best go wide, play as a civ with an early happiness building, like egypt's burial tomb, to ease the early happiness pains."
subject100,0, - probably the biggest hurdle for this to work. early game = only a few workers; late game = less likely a nearby barb camp to capture workers.
subject100,0," - depends. are you going to take kyoto? if so, i'd definitely raze tokyo and resettle (since you have a settler), just to make happiness easier to juggle. plus, as to more citizens, you're getting 3 extra citizens, which isn't a ton. and buildings get destroyed when captured. i'd rather avoid dipping into unhappiness, which capturing both tokyo and kyoto will cause."
subject100,0," - great advice above, and i'll chip in: if you like the civ mechanics, grab beyond earth on a steam sale (like $5ish usd at this point). its not as good as civ, but it has some cool mechanics and would be worth at least a few solid playthroughs."
subject100,0," - i think the largest hurdle for my enjoyment is that you have to read everything! in previous civ games, you had a basic understanding of what a warrior would be, versus a helicopter, versus a frigate. and you had a basic idea of what researching ""economics"" might get you. so even if you didn't understand the ins-and-outs of combat strength numbers, or gold per turn calculations, you had a general idea of ""my economy is kind of weak, economics will probably help that,"" or ""my army needs more help, researching chivalry will give me a boost."" in be, every time i have the choice to research something, i'm stuck reading 2-5 unit/building/wonder descriptions, plus looking at what affinity levels it provides, plus looking at the leaves unlocked and the techs right behind my target. so i can either play on easier levels because i know my tech pathing will be sub-optimal, or i can play on deity-equivalent, but know that every time i can research a new policy, i better make sure that i pick something that matches an appropriate 'guide,' or 'build.' these problems exist in civ v, but since civ v is based on reality, the decisions are much more intuitive."
subject100,0," - how good is just the base game? and if you had just the base game, would boards/sub-reddits still be helpful? for instance, if you only had vanilla civ v, i think much of the discussion on r/civ here would not be applicable."
subject100,0," - anglo-zulu war had some examples, and was depicted in a few old movies, like zulu: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zulu_(1964_film) lots of 'spearmen charging riflemen' scenes."
subject100,0," - use your merchant of venice for a nearby city-state, preferably with one that has strategic luxuries you don't have. one of venice's biggest problems is that if your capital spot doesn't have iron/coal/oil, you are limited in how you can acquire these resources. i usually aim for using my merchant on nearby city states because you will use these city states to send food trade routes (preferably via water) to your capital. so you want city states in a location where (a) you can easily defend the routes from barbarians and (b) where you won't be too far (since early game trade routes are somewhat short). also, don't discount domination. venice ends up in a fun scenario where you get tons of gold from trade, so you can focus all of your production on building wonders, and just use gold to buy buildings/units. it can be hard to juggle picking enemies with keeping trade routes active (since once you get 10+ routes, it can be hard to keep them all unplundered), but you can build up pretty big armies and not worry about drowning in maintenance costs. last tip, i generally don't like to re-roll my start, but definitely play your first game as venice on the coast."
subject100,0," - sometimes diplo victories get boring because you just keep hitting 'next turn.' once you have a large enough influence lead and plenty of gold, its nearly impossible for ais to steal city-states from you. plus, if you play ai diplomacy right (which as venice is pretty easy due to trade route modifiers keeping ais friendly with you), its unlikely that you'll face much attack from other civs. edit: agreed - no reason to downvote you."
subject100,0," - you also have lots of mid-game production to play around with due to national wonder mechanics. national wonder costs go up with the number of cities, so your national college, circus maximus, etc. are all much cheaper due to your only having 1 city. that means you can get these buildings out faster, and coupled with not spending production on settlers, you will have a shot at nabbing a bunch of mid-game wonders that you would otherwise have no chance at, or would need to make large sacrifices to get."
subject100,0," - its not quite the same, but if you play a large map with just you and venice, and no city-states, you basically get to sandbox. add in a 'more luxuries' mod and you can get around the happiness problem that going super-wide creates."
subject100,0," - better yet, smoke some weed and keep playing civ."
subject100,0, - what type of wood did you use?
subject100,0," - i think scrapping the building quest system makes sense, but i think you'll need to take a close look at building yields as a result. because without the quest rewards, buildings end up being significantly less useful. i also almost exclusively choose the ""+ health"" options, so you'll need to make sure that early and mid-game health doesn't become impossible. i don't have a good solution to the mish-mash of affinity points, but i always envision the tech web as a big circle, and i feel like affinity points should be set up so that one-third of the circle is for red points, one-third for blue, and one-third for yellow. i find it weird that a tech would give both blue and yellow. the downside is that you'd have to make sure all of the 'key' buildings aren't tied to just one affinity. maybe one solution is to have fewer techs give affinity points, but have those techs give more points? i would kill for better sorting of the production scroll bar. right now its units, buildings, wonders, and focus. i hate having to scroll through 20 units around end-game just to get to my buildings. to be able to sort by non-military (explorer, colonist, trade depot), land unit, sea unit, orbital unit, buildings, wonders, focus would be so nice. i saw a mod (haven't used it) that added the national wonders concept from civ v. that could be pretty cool, and could be somewhat of a check on the ""constantly expand"" victory method currently favored. another cool mod is ""expanded loadout"" (i think that's the name), where you have say 30 options instead of 12 about what you start with, and generally your starting options are stronger. i think that would be a good way to speed up early game. lastly, another cool mod (again, couldn't use it because i'm not certain it was mac-compatible) was an 'evolving aliens' mod, where aliens get stronger as the game progresses."
subject100,0," - interesting idea, but i think to limit this you also need the concept of diplomatic capital, like in rising tide. otherwise, why not ally with everyone so that you can have 10 chances to give yourself great bonuses like 'subsidize agriculture.'"
subject100,0," - so i could only have 1 alliance? like, if i ally with germany, i can't separately ally with france?"
subject100,0, - makes sense. thanks for clearing up!
subject100,0," - its still quite powerful. assuming a large city, you can generate +18 culture, plus whatever yields (if any) the national park itself provides? granted not every city will have geography that allows you to fully maximize the benefit, but it still feels strong. also, when is the ui unlocked? there could be unintended consequences (ie, a very quick cultural victory) if tr's faction gets access to a ton of tourism in the early game."
subject100,0," - i don't see what this changes, really. if you are firing off lots of nukes, you're going for a domination victory, and you're in the last 10-15% of the game. so the long-term effects aren't going to dissuade anyone if your core cities starve for a few turns before you win. i get that nukes aren't as realistic, but i just accept that civ is not sim world. i don't want there to be a ""rise in skin cancer"" negative population modifier if you chop down too many trees; or ""fish resources disappear after 50 turns from overfishing."" i'd like to see civ show in baby steps that it can manage a dynamic world map before asking for things like nuclear winter."
subject100,0," - it could work if you added in a few more eras after information. of course then you're running less of a typical civ game (based on actual technologies) and something that comes closer to civ v meets beyond earth. i think playing a game where nukes come in around the 50% mark (rather than 85/90%), then this is definitely a worthwhile idea."
subject100,0," - what else are you building that is a better use of time? by that rationale, why build anything once you hit the atomic era (besides spaceship parts for sv). i think its a good wonder, and i almost always have at least 1 great engineer lying around to rush it, if only to deny it to cv civs. if you're playing wide, it is a nice free 6-8 population. more pop = more science. if you're playing tall science, it can be a nice happiness boost if you're getting hit hard by order/auto influence."
subject100,0," - steam says you need 8gb of hard drive space to install. not sure if that's the download size or how much space you ultimately need to reserve for g amp;k. i'd assume that's the absolute max, because if you have bnw, i'd guess there is some overlap of files? but i'm basing that on no actual knowledge."
subject100,0," - not sure, to be honest. it might be that the hard drive needs space to make copies of files, and move things around during the installation? or maybe steam/civ is just giving you extra wiggle room so you don't accidentally fill up your hard drive during installation if other programs run in the background and periodically use up space?"
subject100,0, - thanks. this mod looks great!
subject100,0," - one way i really enjoyed be more was to start a game deciding, for example, ""no matter what, i'm going supremacy and filling out the might tree."" or, ""going harmony and focusing on quests."" civ v, the first few times you play it, has a much shallower learning curve, because everything progresses linearly. be's pool isn't as deep, but it is so wide when you first start. so if you purposefully limit what you plan on doing each game, even if its not optimal, you can get a better feel for the game/mechanics."
subject100,0," - i don't know if they tweaked the ai code, but i have noticed in rt that the ai is much more likely to attack your beacon/gate/etc. still very static victory conditions, but somewhat more challenging."
subject100,0," - unfortunately that is what happens when a game has been around for 5 years. there isn't much new to discuss, and most worthwhile discussions have happened long ago in this sub or on civfanatics."
subject100,0, - i use: -unlimited xp - barbarians. -communitas map mod. -yet not another earth map pack. i love all three. i think most mods also work for mac. the main ones that don't are the community patch and the community balance patch.
subject100,0," - you can play a team game. put yourself on one team and all the other ais on another. if one ai declares war on you (or vice versa), the rest join in. there are unintended consequences, since team-members share science. i haven't personally tried this game setting, so the ai might be even slower at science."
subject100,0," - seconding aztecs. they probably mesh best with opening (and filling) honor, because you can use jaguars to keep up in culture."
subject100,0," - ok, i can see some civs having somewhat unique capitals (mountains for incas, polders for dutch, lakes for aztecs). but otherwise isn't it just going to devolve into giving a city every wonder and building, with improved salt, on a river, with a mountain?"
subject100,0, - are you chewing gum?
subject100,0, - wide is easier when you have a religion that gives a happiness boost (usually through buildings like mosques). try a civ that makes an early religion easier (either celts thru the ua or ethiopia through the ub).
subject100,0," - it does. it is a bit frustrating to partially lose out on a ua, but ethiopia without the combat bonus is still a perfectly fine civ."
subject100,0," - my advice for single player, assuming comparable techs. if you have a tech lead, subtract 1 unit from each: 3 subs with wolfpack promotions in the front, preferably on ocean tiles. i like wolfpack best, because i'm almost always on the offensive with subs. if my subs are getting attacked, i'm doing things wrong. 3 battleships behind them, interspersed with 2 carriers full of fighters on intercept. battleships, i like to get range, then logistics, just because +4 range means that the ai can't hit me with rocket artillery parked in a coastal city. getting to range/logistics, usually i'll have one b-ship get the +land attack tree, and the other get the +sea attack tree. carriers get the +more planes here promotion. 2-3 destroyers behind them. i don't focus much on their promotions, but coastal raider if the ai navy is small, and the +sea attack tree if its large. subs clean out naval units and embarked units. battleships shell the city without taking bombardment fire. destroyers capture the city and provide targets for the ai to waste bomber attacks on. i never use missile cruisers, because i don't usually use nukes/guided missiles (too expensive/slow on marathon). other tactics: if you know the ai has a nuke in the target city, feel free to build a fast-moving ship or two as a sacrificial lamb that gets targeted with the nuke. then your main force moves in. alternatively, use paratroopers or xcom to trigger a nuke by landing nearby the city."
subject100,0, - does a spy prevent a city from launching nukes?
subject100,0," - agreed that they're stronger, but they come an era later. i'd rather start a war with cheaper battleships, get a few promotions that make them nearly as strong as unpromoted missile cruisers. to be honest, both battleships and missile cruisers are so much stronger than all but the best defended city (plus that ai better have red fort) that the extra combat strength of the missile cruiser doesn't change much. maybe i have 2 turns of bombardment instead of three?"
subject100,0," - bombers are nice if the map permits, but if you are playing on larger maps, or if you have a wide ocean, it might be hard to use bombers based in a city to do any damage. and like you said, bombers aren't expendable, so i'm always wary of parking them on carriers. agreed to your second point, though. i love having pairs (or 3) subs just running around sniping any stray ship."
subject100,0," - other good suggestions here, but i would recommend not getting civilization revolutions ii, which is for a mobile/tablet. i love civv and really didn't enjoy civrevii."
subject100,0," - my expectation was some replayability. it was fun for the first 2 games, then quickly got repetitive. but for a $10 usd app, i was expecting more from the 'civ' franchise."
subject100,0," - i can see text once i 'load remaining images.' can't wait for the series, i really likes tqfer 1.0."
subject100,0," - you can build an observatory, which increases the city's science output by 50%."
subject100,0, - did the american conquests yield any techs from the assyrian ua?
subject100,0," - eh, tech trading usually makes gaming the ai too easy. you research tech a, and trade it to civ 2 for b, civ 3 for c, and civ 4 for d. meanwhile those other civs usually aren't smart enough to do the same. i think research agreements and setting production to research focus are more interesting ways to catch up/get ahead in tech."
subject100,0," - most people start building a settler around 4 pop (or 3 pop if you have good production). you definitely nerf your capital growth for the first era as a result, but thats just how the game is designed. you fall behind the ai at the start, and spend the next half of the game catching up."
subject100,0," - heck yeah. i think its easier than science or culture. if you get into early wars and keep your ranged/siege units alive, they can steamroll! normally its hard to capture cities before artillery (due to its +3 range). if you have comp bows or catapults with range+logistics (because they helped churn through the unit carpets that the ai smashed into your cities), they become unstoppable on the offensive."
subject100,0," - playing my first game with extended eras mod. pretty big change for me, since i usually play marathon. its weird cranking out scouts in 3 turns instead of 20. its been fun, but the mod isn't quite balanced for my kind of game, so i'm not sure if i'll make a habit out of it. on one hand, its nice to actually have to prioritize mid-game wonders if i want them. on the other hand, some things (like worlds fair, wc votes, early expansion) seemed to come way too soon."
subject100,0," - play on epic/marathon, and you don't feel the pain nearly as bad. missing out on 20 turns of early growth on quick is backbreaking. on marathon, its not insurmountable. another suggestion to piggyback on: terra's 'new world' is often very lacking luxuries. grab a mod like 'more luxuries' to ensure that your cities don't run into happiness problems, and to ensure that you don't need to settle your second/third city 10+ tiles away."
subject100,0," - your point on luxuries isn't that its a 'bad map.' its a known issue with terra that the new world has fewer luxuries. if you play with some of the mods that add luxuries (i think more luxuries is one), then you can somewhat fix the issue."
subject100,0," - on the right maps (islands, archipelago, any of 'plus' maps), wayfaring can mean a few extra ancient ruins. sometimes it can be meaningful, but sometimes it can yield 4 maps of nearby barbarians."
subject100,0," - its definitely a good mod (so far, i just hit industrial on my game), but overall the game pace is faster than i expected. even though science is technically slower, its not quite marathon pace, because things like: -faster settlers (and therefore quicker expansion); -faster social policies; -faster gp counters; -faster building (so earlier effects of said buildings); all mean that you accumulate science much faster than you would on marathon, so the overall game pace is quicker than expected. but again, i think its good, because it means you have to play better to pull away from the ai for a science lead. in a marathon game, i would have easily gotten first host of wc, and any wonder starting at leaning tower that i wanted. not so in this game (i also played a bit sub-optimally). there is also more of the 'settle every inch of the map' by the ais, like you see in the battleroyale, because even though the mod reduces the ai's 'desire to settle new city' coding, there is still a ton of time in early eras, and settlers come out so quickly. it went so fast that i actually went with 3-city tradition because there just weren't many good spots (might be a function of the map - pangea plus, smack-dab in the middle of 5 other civs). if you want early warring, i am kicking myself for not playing shaka with his -50% melee unit maintenance. it would make early game so much cheaper, though gold has been surprisingly plentiful."
subject100,0," - 1. don't build any wonders for the entire game (excluding national wonders, of course). 2. pick one city to be your military city, which will get barracks, etc. don't build them in other cities (assuming you don't go domination). 3. cities with natural boundaries or on the inside of your empire don't get walls, etc. try these tips for the first few games on difficulty 6, so you can figure out getting your infrastructure up and running. then, when you learn what wonders the ais focuses on, and when you can surpass the ai in science, you can go back in and try to pick up certain wonders, or mess with buildings that don't immediately contribute to empire growth."
subject100,0," - you've got mp in your flair, so it might be true in mp, but its absolutely not true in single player that its always worth founding a new city. in fact, after a certain point in the game (i'd say renaissance), its rarely worth it unless you're getting crucial strategic resources or a needed coastal city, because while the new city might produce more science/culture over its lifetime, you ignore the downsides of timing. its generally much better to get 5 policies on turn 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, for instance, than 6 policies on turn 1, 4, 7, 11, 13 and 14 (numbers pulled from thin air, of course). same for technology. you might end up getting to futurism faster, but you are probably also delaying navigation and plastics and other key mid-game techs."
subject100,0," - this site has a lot of good math. http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/mathematics_of_civilization_v combining with /u/modulardoktor's multipliers depending on your preferred game conditions, you can get a general sense. however, its never a clear case of ""this city will produce 100 science by the time its up and running, therefore it is a good/bad idea."" because you need to take into account timing. a good example is opening rationalism. imagine a world where you have 1 city, and you filled tradition. your next move is to open rationalism once you hit the renaissance. using the link above, you otherwise need 130 culture to go from policy #6 to policy #7 (465 to 595). so if you settle your second city, you now need to go from 465 to 775, meaning you need an aggregate of 290 culture, which is not only 160 more culture, but it also means you now don't get the 10% science bonus from opening rationalism for the number of turns it takes to get 160 more culture. that's not an easy calculus to make. the same is true if you are about to research plastics. standard speed it costs 4100 science to unlock. if you dropped a new city right before starting research, you now need an extra 205 science, and you need to consider that you now have to wait the number of turns it takes to get 205 science to start building your research lab, meaning x turns of a lower science output."
subject100,0," - i'm by no means a deity domination expert, so i defer to others (might be worth a general subreddit post), but usually its map/neighbor dependent. i typically go for domination when i've gotten to repel an early attack, built up an army with +5 promotion units while playing defense, and then counterattack. hard to do that when everyone leaves you alone."
subject100,0," - for me it depends on how much i'm expecting to get out of my religion. for instance, if i'm settled near desert and have desert folklore, i'm probably going to fight hard to keep my religion up. similarly, if i have the +faith to wonders and have a few natural wonders in my borders, i'll at least place inquisitors to ward off direct religious pressure. but typically, if i see a neighbor going heavy religion (or a civ that is strong in early faith), i'll set up my religion to be mostly faith buildings. that way, i get the benefit of buying the building in my cities, but then when i get converted mid- and late-game, i don't care, because i've already gotten the benefit."
subject100,0," - each citizen (so 1 population) gives 1 science. you can also get science from buildings (like the library), policies (mainly rationalism), external trade routes, and religion. but population is your main source, which is why so many guides emphasize growing your cities as large as possible (and which is why tradition is such a strong 1st policy tree)."
subject100,0," - 1st q - balance mostly. 2nd q - i go 2x siege (+dmg to cities) or 2x bombardment (+dmg to land units) [decision depends on how my war looks - am i just starting a war, and need to clear out units, or am i mid-war and looking to cap some cities], so that i can unlock air repair. similar to 'march' for melee units, it lets you bomb and repair each turn. you won't heal 100% every time, but it means you spend more turns attacking (and getting more xp), and less downtime. after that, i'll pick promotions depending on the map. usually i'll get the +range promotions, since i play on larger maps, but sometimes evasion is nice when coupled with air repair if the ai has lots of fighters or anti-air. 3q - if i have a tech lead, i rarely need fighters. so i'll just load up on bombers and use them the same as i use artillery. they soften up the front line troops so my infantry can march in untouched. i'll usually target infantry and siege units, since that way my bombers take less damage (than say attacking a gatling gun). without a tech lead can be tougher, but i'll just sprinkle in a fighter or two to perform intercepts. it won't keep your units completely safe, but it will slowly whittle away an enemy air force. i typically like to build a few extra infantry when i'm against a good air force, and just use those units as cannon fodder while i move my artillery into place to hammer a city. typically vs the ai, once your army gets close to a city, they will evacuate their planes so that they aren't destroyed in the siege."
subject100,0," - its a good strategy but you need to pay attention to make sure another ai doesn't run away with diplomatic votes or influence. sometimes waiting for late game gives your enemies too much time to win before you're ready to make your domination push. similarly, if another ai has conquered 3-4 neighbors, you might be in a tough spot where you can't complete domination before someone hits a science victory. also, when you say 'go down liberty,' are you starting with liberty? or after you finish tradition?"
subject100,0," - i would try a tradition/rationalism game. liberty is certainly strong, but the benefits don't really shine until late game when you've started your push to dominate and you have multiple cities. tradition will give you a bit more bang for your buck (especially if you're only building 3 cities) in the early game, meaning you might get a tech lead sooner than usual. the major downside is the lack of free settler/faster settler production, but landed elite in tradition is really strong and will help make up for that lost period of growth."
subject100,0," - agreed about happiness. i'm hopeful civ vi gets closer to beyond earth, where its much easier to manage. i often fill out liberty once i get trad/rat/ideology. the right side of the liberty tree is particularly useful in war. if you have a team of workers building roads behind your army to connect conquered cities, you can keep happiness up and you have an easier time replenishing lost troops."
subject100,0," - good points by saroop. the general idea is that with wide, life is harder earlier on, but later in the game, you have 5-8 very strong cities. once those cities get up and running, they easily overcome the penalties to science and culture you get from settling extra cities."
subject100,0," - i think you'll want a mod. if i recall, the 'abundant,' 'normal' or 'scarce' options relate to strategic resources, not luxury resources?"
subject100,0," - settle your satellite cities on a hill, or on a river (where they'd have to cross the river to attack). those 2 bonuses alone can greatly limit the ai's ability to effectively siege you. another good idea is to save up some cash, or use a luxury copy, to bribe the aggressive civ to attack another neighbor. either a. you join in the war and maybe scoop up a free city, or b. shaka/alex/bismarck and neighbor fight each other while you pop out a few settlers. then, later on, if shaka has knocked out your neighbor, you lead the world in denouncing that warmonger shaka, and lead a coalition of the willing to liberate his lands (which you keep the best of, of course)."
subject100,0,every game when i'm the first to research artillery - 
subject100,0," - i was itching for a berlin snipe to be 'the grand trick.' probably best not to become a complete pariah in the diplomatic world for a dof backstab, though."
subject100,0," - really cool ideas. some of these would be really op (imagine backstabbing a friend, stealing a capital, then popping a hand of the king; or combining petra with the dornish ub), but they are very creative and do a great job of capturing the got faction themes in a way that some of the existing mods don't."
subject100,0," - oh, i didn't mean to criticize any of the designs. i think overall its a great idea, with lots of good thoughts about uu/ua/ubs that aren't in the base game. now its time for you to teach yourself modding so we can enjoy these civs :)"
subject100,0," - it wouldn't be your typical 'civ' game, but for the dothraki you could give them their one city vael dothrak (i think?), and they couldn't settle any other cities until x technology. that way their early game is based more around raiding the free states. another option, though its less 'canon,' but either (a) make the free states start the game at say 5-6 pop, so they're much stronger than the dothraki, and (b) give each free state 2-4 'cities' that are all close together and comprise 1 megapolis. not sure how that would work coding a tsl map, but that would solve some of the issue of the dothraki having tons of wide open spaces to claim. one final thought to limit the dothraki's ability to swarm essos as the only civ there (until the other civs figure out colonization): the dothraki, when they build a settler, lose x% of the population from the city. it would mimic a bunch of the dothraki clans leaving one khal to join up with another."
subject100,0," - depends on the era. renaissance and early, yeah sure. i am always fighting against the rising tide of unhappiness, and the buildings are cheaper early on. industrial era and i'm getting ideologies soon, probably not."
subject100,0," - its an interesting idea, but i don't think i'd enjoy it, for a few reasons. 1. there are already many factors that control a decision to pick a policy or wonder. take the eiffel tower, i need to weigh the possible lost production, not prioritizing infrastructure/army during construction, whether i 'need' the benefits. now i also need to (a) review my current cultural attitudes, figure out what the wonder's effects will be, and (c) figure out whether building it nerfs me in some other way (because now i lose eg 10gpt from piety)? maybe this decision comes easily with civ vi's version of eui, but i doubt the base game has a method that makes this a seamless decision mid-game, without having to click around to 2-3 screens. 2. your examples fit the mechanic very well, but consider many other civ v wonders/great works. does the statue of zeus really distinctly support individualism vs conformism? or big ben? similarly for great works, how does homer's odyssey move the sliders? i worry that you're (a) creating a lot more work for civ designers to 'get it right' when figuring out how to classify these wonders/gw, and (b) requiring an even amount of both choices (you can't just have everything push to patience vs efficiency), which might be forcing a square peg in a round hole. 3. using wonders/great works to move these sliders and get cultural benefits is problematic because, in higher level games, you likely won't be getting any of these until mid/late game, and in easier games, artist/writer/musician generation is still random, so you're boxed out of the meta game. you might want to play a 'secularism' game, but since the ai rushes the great library every game, you can't. or, you keep getting dante aligheri and boticelli as your great writer/artist, and it is impossible to play how you want to. 4. balance. the more sliders or specializations or focuses you create means that its more likely that you have to play a certain way to win at higher difficulties. you acknowledge that you can micromanage for benefits, or otherwise ignore it. but if we're realistic, chances are there will be a few synergies that will become necessary for deity/immortal. i think we can all agree it would be nice if you could choose any of trad/lib/hon/piety on any difficulty and still do well, but its just not the case. if developers struggle to come up with 4 reasonably balanced trees, how likely is it that 5-6 sliders that each affect these trees, and future wonders, are also well-balanced? all of these issues seem like you run into situations where you have to make these choices that feel like shooting yourself in the foot: 'well, i really want this wonder/great work, but due to early game rng, i am stuck with one extreme attitude, and this wonder/great work is on the other side.' i like the concept though (and i apologize for a wall of criticism), and i really like that this system can be a cool learning tool. because before your post, i had no idea whether confusius wrote supporting conformism vs individualism, and one of my favorite parts of civ is how much you learn without even trying to. so maybe you still have these cultural attitudes, but instead you earn currency that you can choose to spend on various sliders? i'm not sure if you are familiar with civ beyond earth:rising tide, but the diplomatic capital system i think worked similarly, and pretty well. you earned currency from quests and certain buildings (here it could be wonders and great people), and you could spend it on either (a) your own traits, that would exist permanently, or (b) traits from the ai that you'd get for a few turns, like trading for a luxury in civv. so if you bought traits that gave you more trade routes, and bought a contract to get gold from farms, you'd get an 'economist' trait, and diplomatically you got a friendship boost with ai that had the same trait, and a negative modifier for ais that had the 'growth-focused' trait (just examples, can't recall actual traits)."
subject100,0," - if you have the technology required (eg, mining and you settle on salt), then yes."
subject100,0, - one option is to start games in later eras. that way you get to do your warmongering with the units that you typically don't bother building because you're well on your way to a science/culture/diplo victory.
subject100,0," - i can understand the desire to make things more dynamic. it does kind of stink when you start a game on a smaller landmass, and within 15 turns you know, ""okay, my best chance is tradition/science turtle until frigates,"" or something like that, and you kind of go through the motions for awhile. i think culture/social policies will be one of the big targets for change in civvi (based on how each dlc tweaked it, and both versions of be also revised it), so it will be cool to see what the developers come up with."
subject100,0, - so you found australians in australia...? :d
subject100,0," - not sure, but i'm curious what you plan on editing out, if you are inclined to share."
subject100,0," - no, that's a very cool idea. and if you got it to work, you could do similar things with ""stop at knights + archers,"" etc. one method that hasn't been referenced is to directly fiddle with tech costs via a mod. if you made all the techs you don't want researched cost 1,000,000 science points, you'd effectively make them impossible. i'm at work so i can't click through the links, but there a modding forum on civfanatics that might have enough info on how to do a basic mod that does this."
subject100,0, - marathon speed best speed!!
subject100,0," - you toiled and struggled, and in your darkest hour, your archnemesis cut you down. you bid goodbye to the earth while you lay in a pool of blood in your ancestral home and capital, while enemy cannon rained down ruin everything you ever built, and your people (your friends, your lovers, your family) were put to the sword by nameless and faceless infantrymen. you saw the afterlife, and stood face to face with the gaping maw of eternity. you became a point of light, where the universe's past, present and future all existed in an instant and forever, and all of human knowledge and experience unfurled before you. but in a flash, with neither rhyme nor reason, someone yanked you back to our mortal coil, shoved a bushel of oranges in your hands, and told to be happy. adding insult to injury, now you are told you should build some markets to trade worthless baubles, and some stables so that you can make use of the herds of horses that have taken up residence outside your bombed out homeland? you, who have seen the futility of man's battle against the sands of time, who have seen, in the blink of an eye, every empire built up and thrown down, are chided that you aren't making enough use of an iron mine in a nearby hill? you tell me why our resurrected brethren would fail so mightily."
subject100,0," - jungle cities start slower, but produce more later. its definitely a trade-off, and can make for a challenging first few eras. but if you survive, your cities can really take off late game."
subject100,0," - right, but consider base tile yields (not beginning to count food and science multipliers from policies and buildings). imagine you could either have jungle plains or forest plains/hills. if you have forest plains, you'd chop the forest, and build a farm, so base yield of 2f/1p, plus get a production boost from the forest chop. at civil service or fertilizer, you go up to 3f/1p. if you have a forest hill, you'd chop and build a mine, so base yield 0f/3p. at chemistry, 0f/4p. now assume jungles. you don't build anything, and sit on 2f/0p. at universities, you get 2f/2s, and with brazilwood after acoustics, you get 2f/2s/0p/2c/2g. so for brazilwood, you are gimped until machinery/universities (medieval era). at machinery/universities, you go to 2f/2s/2g, and at acoustics (renaissance and on the 'science building' track), you go to 2f/2s/2g/2c. so from classical to renaissance, you fall behind. at renaissance you start quickly catching up, and that catch-up slows down a bit in industrial (when farms/mines improve). you're correct that you lose out on production. but the hope is that 1. you make up for the lack of production elsewhere (either internal trade routes, or by building some mines and chopping a jungle tile or two, and 2. you end up with resources that get earlier 'multipliers.' so your science gets the benefit of universities, observatories, rationalism opener, rlabs, nat college; your culture with broadcast towers, etc; your gold with markets, etc."
subject100,0," - agreed from a 'fair game,' perspective that buffed luxuries would create an auto-win scenario. but from a 'wanting to have fun with a unique scenario,' the lack of luxuries can be painful. i've played this a few times, and it is hard to do much of anything without any luxuries in your capital (or maybe 1). i play on marathon, so you're looking at 100+ turns before you can even consider building a coliseum/circus. i just find it frustrating when you have the whole continent to fill up with settlers, but not enough happiness to support that strategy."
subject100,0," - definitely not worth 10 bucks. i played a few games on each difficulty level (i think there are 5 or 6)? everything but the first few difficulty levels were mindless. you get every wonder, and jump to a massive lead right away. on the hardest difficulty, you are basically totally boned, because so many of the victory conditions don't require you to get close to end-game. very unsatisfying because for $10, i'd like a fair bit of replayability. if i'm getting  lt;10 hours of watered down civ, i'd rather just keep cycling the 10,000 f2p games on googleplay. or, if you really want the 4x experience, find in-browser games that work decently on a tablet, like freeciv."
subject100,0," - i think he means civ rev 2, which currently has the $10 price tag. i couldn't find civ rev 1 on the google play store."
subject100,0," - yeah, check out the side bar, below 'subreddit rules.' there should be a link there. there is also an app in the google play store for freeciv."
subject100,0," - marathon! you can wage war in any era you want, and you have to worry less about the ai's fast early game. when it takes 15 turns to build a warrior, you don't need to worry as much about unit carpets."
subject100,0," - my understanding of it is that, for science, they have the same tech level as an average of all of the ai civs. they earn culture through buildings, which explains why they slowly gain city tiles. i'm not sure if particular city states have a focus for which buildings/units they produce, but when you buy a city state with venice or marry one with austria, they typically have been building the same kinds of buildings that the ai would generally build."
subject100,0," - i'd be interested; it sounds like a really cool idea. i'd recommend adding way more civv civs, though. otherwise you end up with a cramped western europe (4 in your current pole), and a 2 civs responsible for colonizing the entirety of the americas. take a look at the /r/civbattleroyale layout. you don't need to have 61 civs, of course, but you want to make sure that you have enough civs so that each landmass is similarly represented."
subject100,0," - agreed, it does make it hard to line up sponsorships. if you don't play as the america civs, it might not be a problem, since you could personally ensure that neither america nor brazil snowball."
subject100,0," - i like playing with the communitas map script, or otherwise play fractal or continent for games like you mention. i play on huge or large maps, add 2 or 4 more ai civs than recommended (so 10 to 12 on large, i think). typically with these map types, you get to play 2 sub-games. first few eras, you play against the 4-5 civs that immediately border you. once you unlock frigates, etc., you have a second sub-game where you go up against the remaining civs, one or 2 of which have probably snowballed. so now you have a reasonably difficult challenge fighting an ai that has a tech lead/tech parity, more cities, or both. edit: and you often have the bonus of needing to transport your army across large distances or oceans, which adds a degree of difficulty and forces you to really figure out how much firepower you'll need to land a foothold in the enemy ai's territory."
subject100,0," - there's quite a bit of discussion on build order, so i'd recommend searching the subreddit. but the general idea is: scout, scout, shrine or monument (depending on what ruins you find, and what policies you plan on taking). the 2x scouts are useful for getting more ruins/meeting cses/stealing workers, but are also map dependent (if you are playing small islands or archipelago, less of a need for 2x scouts). staying in the black with your economy is definitely a challenge. i find 2 good ways to make sure i can afford my early-game army. 1. choose good settlement locations. a city on a hill, with a river between the city and the ai, means i can defend with 2 archers instead of 4, for instance. the enemies lose combat strength crossing a river, and the hill provides more defense. 2. use your money/luxuries in diplomacy. you can sell a luxury for 7gpt, which gives you basically 7 more units. those 7 units will be helpful in a war against shaka, but it might save you more money in the long run to send that luxury to shaka to induce him to go to war with alexander. now you don't need as many units, because your 2 neighbors are fighting each other. i found it took a few games before i had a good sense of how many defensive units would be enough to stay alive, and unfortunately there's no clear answer because so much depends on terrain."
subject100,0," - gotcha. a few other thoughts? try starting a game in a later era? instead of ancient, maybe jump right to renaissance? then you won't have a lead until later in the game? try disabling some victory conditions? agreed that when you get a big tech lead at industrial, you can basically auto-pilot to science victory. but if you don't let yourself do that by disabling sv from the outset, you might force yourself out of your comfort zone? set up 'abnormal' starts/scenarios, where you don't play the typical 4-city tall? games like playing polynesia on terra (check out the civ of the month thread), or playing on archipelago against good naval civs (england, ottomans, portugal). or playing on maps like great plains against good melee civs (attila, mongols, shaka, alex, inca). lots of these games either force you to change up your usual gameplay, or give the ais a bit more of a bonus than just the difficulty level gives. so you will likely still win, but these civs will stay competitive longer?"
subject100,0," - to follow up on ugafan, imagine getting a science lead even more effortlessly."
subject100,0," - when your citizens don't work (ie, not assigned a specialist slot or a tile to work), they are called 'laborers' and provide +1 production. good question by op; not sure if they do (and therefore get the benefits of freedom tenets)."
subject100,0," - great points by shuipz. remember that population more or less equals science. venice, due to having 1 real city, and 2-4 other cities it can't quite control (and therefore maximize the growth of) will comparatively have very low population. if you have the gold and are on the water, start building up a strong navy to defend your trade routes. being a tech era behind on land can be tough to overcome, because infantry units are such a raw numbers game. but out on the ocean, with the ai being terrible at naval combat, the tech disparity isn't as painful. a navy with 4-5 promoted frigates won't fare as poorly against battleships/destroyers (especially playing defense and able to heal in friendly territory) as a comparable battle between crossbowmen and gatling guns, for example."
subject100,0," - really good advice so far elsewhere. some other points: don't worry too much about racing for ideologies, since you will likely want freedom for its specialist bonuses and treaty organization (+influence with each cs you send a trade route to). and freedom is usually not prioritized by the ai. treaty org is in my opinion the most op tenet, especially with venice, as it basically guarantees a single player diplo win. also, remember that you can nab an ancient/classical era wonder or 2 that you otherwise can't with regular civs, because a. you don't waste production on settlers and b. your capital will grow faster because you won't have 3+ settlers worth of growth stagnation. don't be afraid to reroll starts for your first venice game. a bad start (tundra; non-coast) is still winnable, but it won't be as much fun."
subject100,0," - keep on rolling. you have a full era where your +ranged chukonus will be dominant and are the ideal siege weapons. once you hit industrialization, +range gatling guns are significantly less useful for taking cities. pay the rest of the world to help fight indonesia and portugal, so that you don't get backstabbed mid-war. then, when you've conquered both, you can fight just a 2-front war vs everyone else."
subject100,0," - 1. not certain if you get the railroad connection production buff through harbors. 2. typical answer is to steal workers from the ai or city-states. i don't like to do that, so i usually fit a worker in after my granary. rushing great library is fine on lower levels, but isn't recommended on higher ones. 3. only if i can't handle the happiness."
subject100,0," - might be a mac/pc thing, but i've always been very impressed that civ v runs so well on my 2010 mac laptop. i'm looking to upgrade soon as well, and if i do, i'm confidant whatever i buy in the coming months would have plenty of juice. admittedly i play on low graphics, and i'm not running 61 civ battle royales."
subject100,0," - ""if you want to get super technical..."" we don't."
subject100,0," - if i have a good source of faith and plan on going wide, i choose 2 buildings (mosques, pagodas, cathedrals) as a nice boost to happiness. i also like combining either religious texts or itinerant preachers with tithe. that way its easier to spread your religion, making tithe earn you more gold. [nice thread on rt vs ip: https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1bxpxa/which_better_itinerate_preachers_or_religious/] those are my two usual choices if i have my pick of beliefs."
subject100,0," - i think you can make a good argument for temple/garden one, if you know every city will have a river/lake. the one downside of the happiness beliefs is that you need to maintain your religion to keep the effects, whereas the happiness buildings stay (and keep giving happiness/culture) even if you get spammed with missionaries. i find that its pretty close to a wash in terms of faith cost to either (a) buy a faith building in each city, or (b) park an inquisitor in each city. but i also play on marathon, so the gs/ge faith costs really skyrocket once you buy a couple (e.g., 5,000 to 7,500 faith), which means that spending an extra 200 or 300 faith in the early eras doesn't affect how many gs/ges i can buy at the end game."

subject100,0," - a few thoughts: 1. are you building guilds? writer/artist guilds with specialists staffed are quite useful (music guild only for cultural victory) for producing culture, and gw treatise or ga golden age is a nice buff. 2. generally if you are going science, just go science. if you are going culture, just go culture. don't worry about allying cultural city states if it won't advance your victory conditions. 3. if you want to win a cultural victory, you need to prioritize culture from a very early stage. that means building cultural buildings early (though not earlier than science buildings), playing the great works mini-game, and choosing policies that aid culture/cultural great people (certain aesthetics ones in particular). you still need science in cultural victory games, but you don't play the same as you would for your usual science/domination/diplo via gold victories."
subject100,0," - great post. i've often thought how to compare faith costs, and i like your use of baseline buildings (monument, circus, etc.) to come up with a method. i agree that pagodas and mosques are by far the best bets, but i'd almost always prefer pagodas on any difficulty above 4. you reference it a bit, but its really important to emphasize that 1 happiness does not equal 1 faith. we generally struggle to compare yield values in civ v (eg, would you trade 1 culture for 1 faith? or 3 faith), but you can at least have those discussions because most of the yields in this game are a currency of some sort. if i have 100 culture per turn and 20 faith per turn, i can tell myself ""take the faith, its a 5% boost vs a 1% boost."" similarly, those yields are tied to victory condition goals. so you might take 1 culture over 3 faith if you are aiming for a cultural victory. happiness isn't directly a currency (though it does yield golden age points), but rather a metric that either provides nothing (because happiness  gt; 0) or incurs serious costs (because happiness  lt; 0). therefore, if you are sufficiently 'happy' for your expansion (which should be relatively clear by medieval/renaissance) the extra happiness doesn't really give you a benefit. if on the other hand, you are struggling to stay at or above 'happy,' that +1 happiness from pagodas is invaluable, because there is a finite number of methods to increase your happiness. once you've built all of your buildings and filled out your first policy tree and settled all of your cities, you aren't likely to find new significant sources of happiness until ideologies. since i'm almost always struggling with happiness until mid-game, i'm almost always picking pagodas if available. measuring whether its the 'efficient use of faith' is very cool, but the unhappiness penalties really mess up how to measure efficiency in the context of purchasing happiness."
subject100,0," - there's 2 sets of point counters: artists/musicians/writers contribute to one set; scientists/merchants/engineers contribute to a second set. so getting lots of artists, musicians and writers does not affect getting scientists. but getting lots of merchants and engineers does."
subject100,0," - caravels for me. i almost exclusively play huge maps, so i'll have 1 or 2 caravels scouting for hundreds of years. its not worth the gold upgrade costs to improve them to ironclads (less movement), and by the time destroyers are available, i definitely don't want to pay for a double-upgrade just to scout."
subject100,0," - all of these have been great, but this part was especially good. ""for the sake of our libraries."" :d"
subject100,0," - depends on difficulty, but basically multiple their spawn time on regular times 3."
subject100,0," - depends on your game goals. domination victory? yes, definitely. you now have 2x foothold with a ton of units in the new world. diplomatic/science? probably not. hard to defend, slows down your eventual victory conditions (slower science; losing allied cs votes in wc)."
subject100,0," - your science wouldn't suffer much. but on the other hand, annexing wouldn't really help if you are going for a science victory. venice is fun to play, but the annexed city-states are notoriously bad at prioritizing growth and science (like a normal player would). so you get stuck with the increased tech costs from having a new city, but don't have control over the mechanics that let you overcome the cost by growing and working the right tiles/specialists. in this instance, you are stuck with twice the penalties, since you'd get 2 cities, as well as now having 14 more units to support. you could disband many of those units, but you need to keep enough to fend off a pissed off inca/iriquous for 'forward-settling,' and you also need to dump a bunch of cash to buy the important buildings (ie library and granary) that the cses probably failed to build. if you are playing on a difficulty you regularly win on, then go ahead and annex them. it will make the game more fun, you'll have more stuff to do, and you might get to fight a fun war. but if you're worried about winning and think it might be close, annexing these 2 cities will probably not increase your odds of winning."
subject100,0," - one other consideration/possibility. i noticed you have 3 of 12 trade routes in use. you could justify annexing by saying that ""i want to run trade routes from these cities to the inca/iriquois cities and make gold."" that is one reasonable option, and justifies annexing. ideally you run all your routes from coastal venice, but in your case, it looks like there aren't a ton of available ai cities on the coasts."
subject100,0," - no, i prefer getting shaka/attila/other warmongers. if you plan for an invasion (ie, have 2-3 archers and a few meat-shields), and make sure your trade routes are safe, you put yourself in good shape. 1. shaka spends the early game production on units and not infrastructure or settlers. 2. you kill all of his units because you smartly perch archers on hills or behind rivers. 3. you have nicely promoted early units that let you go on the offensive or defend with fewer units. 4. you now have a neighbor that has crippled himself by wasting his early game on military and now has nothing to show for it. feel free to now settle the best spots and/or take his capital with minimal warmonger penalty. if you're the kind of player who 'has to get great library,' or gets a nervous tic if national college isn't built by turn 100, then sure, re-roll. having to play early game defense definitely sets you back. but the benefits can be enormous."
subject100,0, - but the flip side would be absurd. george washington in a bear belt during the ancient era?
subject100,0," - not much of a 'defense,' but i find having a couple of units as 'target practice' sometimes works. if you have some tanks/infantry out in front of your main army, sometimes you can lure the ai to nuke those units, instead of your main force or a city."
subject100,0, - the series really fell off after the civ i friends amp;family alpha...
subject100,0," - most people start building settlers once their capital has 3 or 4 population. how many you build depends on 1. the map, and 2. your decision to go tall or wide."
subject100,0, - shaka basically getting any melee unique unit for the lower maintenance cost. or shaka (+25% xp) getting a keshik (+50% xp). makes getting promotions mighty easy. songhai (+embarked defense) getting danish beserker is nice. inca getting norwegian ski infantry (swedish unit with +hill combat bonus and movement). jaguars getting celtish pictish warrior. getting culture and faith from kills? yes please.
subject100,0,"your human-controlled civ gets to take 1 ai city and try to win br mk.ii. which city and what's your strategy? - i was anxiously awaiting this week's great br album and got to thinking. if i could take any city away from an ai civ, and then play to win world domination, what's the best move? pick a desolate antarctic city and slowly expand? or build a wonder-filled capital but be surrounded by a super-power like the boers? some rules to guide discussion: 1. you start with the average gold, tech level and social policies of the median 'real' civs. so drop off the zero-city and one-city, and you are on par with someone like canada or mongolia. 2. you get a 2-tile ring around the city, and all units contained in the city and that 2-tile ring. 3. you are diplomatically neutral: the ai you took the city from isn't upset at you, and you are neutral with every other civ, with no accrued warmonger penalties. you still have 'they covet land/wonders you currently own' from neighbors. 4. you get the population of the city, but if the population is artificially inflated by deity ai bonuses, you'll suffer from starvation. 5. you get all of the buildings in the city that your tech level has unlocked. its likely that most of these ai cities skipped granaries and circuses, but let's pretend like they haven't. 6. i assume you are a blank-slate civ with no uas, ubs or uus, since at this tech level most of those are obsolete. but feel free to choose a specific non-markii firaxis/jfd/coloniallegacies civ. i could see shoshone's +combat in friendly territory being especially useful in the early game, for instance. i'm sure i'm missing some other key considerations, but let's use these as our ground rules. so where do you start, and what do you do to win? i thought the best bet might be to take a kimberley city in the south pacific and quickly take over chile, because ai navies are always much easier to defeat. however, you're basically walking into the bucc/brazil warzone. north africa was also promising, since you'd be surrounded by a bunch of second-tier civs, and you'd have a nice buffer zone between you and dominant civs like the boers, finland and iceland. all in all, i think it would be a really fun exercise. you'd be way behind on production, and would be constantly struggling against unit carpets. on the other hand, with the massive treasury you'd have at your disposal, you could quickly rush an army/navy of your choosing, and you could influence diplomacy and dows quite a bit."
subject100,0," - you only get the lux/strategic resource once you have the tech. i think (but am not sure) that you still get the +1 forge bonus, because you 'have a source of iron.' settling on luxuries is a good strategy for wide empires (more than 4 cities), because you immediately get the happiness boost for your satellite cities, meaning you don't spend 5-10 turns dealing with reduced growth from unhappiness. i am less inclined to settle on luxuries when going tall, because usually there are more optimal spots to settle."
subject100,0, - good call on rome! rome has probably the perfect buffer of low-tier civs to feast on before you border any powerhouse civs.
subject100,0," - i feel the same way about deity, but in my head, this is the perfect way to play deity. no need to worry about rushing settlers or dealing with forward-settles. just war and diplomacy, which the human is generally better at."
subject100,0," - well for me the gold thing is what really gives you a fighting chance. being able to rush-buy enough units to take a few neighboring cities would be crucial. i opted for the 2-tile ring because so many cities are so cramped that taking the 3-tile ring might really nerf your ai neighbors in certain instances. i assumed you get the 2-tile ring, and if the 3rd ring is open, your cultural borders eventually spread there like normal."
subject100,0," - the /u/lordberric excel spreadsheet has a list of which city has which wonder. i'm not sure how recently it was updated, but it definitely has the early game wonders. good questions. 1 - yes to all units in the 2-tile ring, regardless of owner. 2. - yes to religion. i hadn't even thought of the benefits of judaism, so for such a great point i think you should get the benefit. edit: excel sheet links here: https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/4d5b07/battle_royale_mkii_megathread/"
subject100,0," - did we ever see any 'faith per turn' numbers for david? also, great user name. i'm going to go re-watch that 'toon now."
subject100,0," - to follow up on syenite, the ai rarely prioritizes city buildings or improves their tiles correctly. therefore, on marathon, you get the benefits of a library for 100 turns before the ai builds their's, rather than 10 or 15 turns like you would on quick."
subject100,0, - here comes george/in control...
subject100,0," - settle lots of cities, choose quest choices that give health and make settling cities easier. settle more cities, prioritize trade routes. there are definitely a few 'strategies,' like rushing spies (especially if you are arc), but not in the same way as civ v. rising tide opened up the meta a bit more, with scout exploration being more important, so you can have a strategy of 'spam explorers to uncover every artifact, satellite, and quest spawn,' but its more gimmicky than anything."
subject100,0," - rising tide definitely improved the game, but if funds are a concern, definitely wait until it is less than $20 on steam sales. it made the game more fun, and i enjoyed a few games of 'aquatic cities' only, but it certainly did not turn be from 'novelty game i played a few times' to civ v-replayability game."
subject100,0," - i always loved the total war mechanic, where you had the more abstract 'army construction/army movement' tactics on the main game screen, but actual battles occurred in sub-screens where there was tons of emphasis on tactics. i don't think that such a mechanic would work for civ, given how much more fighting takes place, but it would be interesting."
subject100,0," - i haven't, but it is on my steam wishlist. i'm currently gaming on a 2010 macbook pro, so i might wait until the next machine to try it out. it looks great though."
subject100,0, - just theoretical. i can't imagine a game where you would be allied enough with a military city state to be getting a steady stream of units in the ancient/classical era. maybe if you set a mod to stop tech after the first two eras?
subject100,0," - if your carpet is over 4-6 cities, sure. if its spanning all of africa like the boers on a huge map, probably not. you'd run up against unit limits in that case too."
subject100,0," - depends on my game. if i'm on the offensive, i use cavalry units. because at that point i'm mostly using my garrison troops to handle barbarians that wander into my territory, or the odd cs enemy. so i prefer to have the extra mobility. if i'm peaceful or playing defense, i park my promoted range or siege units, just to save on unit maintenance (because i probably went tradition)."
subject100,0," - not sure, but bumping this post because i agree 100%. my least favorite part of this game is that the mini-map is worthless. every color blends into the other. might be my fault for playing low-res on a laptop, but its really frustrating."
subject100,0," - the production boost might be a little silly in the cbr mid-game, when you have a dozen ais declaring war on you, even though you're 2 continents away and functionally can't fight each other even if you wanted to."
subject100,0, - agreed. and it might give germany the juice it needs to survive the cbr hellscape that is early/mid-game central europe.
subject100,0," - really great stuff! the first 2 were on no-ocean maps. it might be fun to do a large islands or archipelago map with a ton of civs and cses, using a strong naval civ. i'd actually recommend against venice, since so much of the game would be building and defending trade routes, which might be hard to narrate. i'd also recommend adding a few mods that help with happiness, so you can safely pursue global domination without those pesky rebels."
subject100,0, - use a pikeman or other melee unit as a pivot point se of the lake. it will encourage the ai to embark its units into the lake to make melee attacks. easy kills from ranged this way.
subject100,0," - sharing a religion reduces influence degradation by 25%. so there's a chance that poland had either gunboat diplomacy or the trade route perk, and just like you, was getting net positive influence per turn. coupled with the patronage social policy opener, he could be in a position where he is getting more influence per turn than you. its a tough spot to be in, because the best way to reverse this course is to go to war with poland. of course, that sets the city state allies also at war with you. you could send inquisitors to the citystates to nuke poland's religion, but that is time intensive and it might take forever to get your inquisitors in place."
subject100,0, - grab a religion with happiness boosts. play as a civ that has a ub that gives happiness. settle directly on luxury resources. use your excess gold to either ally with cses or buy extra luxuries from the ai. or just download the 'no happiness' mod :)
subject100,0," - they're a solid civ. their downside is that, on higher difficulties, going after wonders is a dangerous strategy. the ai has a huge headstart, so more often than not, you end up trying to build a wonder, but the ai finishes it first. on lower difficulties, though, they are a lot of fun. they are a very good civ to learn the game with."
subject100,0," - great points by kablewie, but to follow up, you are assuming that the moment in time you settle this city, you have a worker in place and able to improve the luxury. typically though, your workers will be busy elsewhere. that means that you might settle the city but not connect the luxury for 10, 15 or 20 turns. if the new city sends you below zero happiness, you now have 10+ turns of lowered growth and production. its much more important to avoid this debuff than it is to get 1 extra gold over the course of the game."
subject100,0, - seems pretty selfish of you not to do daily posts. /s
subject100,0, - its been great so far. keep up the great work!
subject100,0, - does the timer for signal degradation scale with game speed? just downloaded the mod yesterday and i'm excited to test it out this weekend on marathon.
subject100,0," - shuip's explanation is great, but just as a more basic point. desert tiles are usually bad, so settling in a desert isn't something you usually want to do. petra can make a desert city very strong."
subject100,0," - i think its lame. i get that its necessary on deity (and sometimes immortal), but its poor game design that its needed on higher difficulties, and its just a cheesy exploit on the lower ones."
subject100,0," - depends. assuming its a '3 wishes' scenario, then its a gift from the genie. therefore, its not taxable for you, because gifts aren't included in your income. the genie is going to have to pay tax on the gift, though the genie is probably not a us taxpayer, assuming he is spending the majority of his time in the astral plane. the irs might have a better case if he is a genie in a lamp, and the lamp spends the majority of the year on us soil. if that's the case, then the irs can claim that the $1b is income to the genie. the generation of $1b is arguably going to fall under 'illegal activities,' as the money is either forged or stolen. income from illegal activities is still taxable. total tax amount is hard to estimate, given the availability of certain deductions, as well as state and local tax rates, but the genie is likely going to owe ~$450m to the irs, not including fees and penalties."
subject100,0," - well then we get into the whole issue of the irs even being able to properly serve the genie. if your home is a lamp, i doubt service of process guidelines in most states would work. further, even if the genie gets hauled in front of a court, his assets are in the astral plane, and i don't think any us state or federal courts have reciprocity with astral plane enforcement authorities. i think at best the irs is putting a lien on the genie's assets and garnishing future wages, which is likely to produce no actual income. definitely something our lawmakers need to look into. when people complain about the tax code being full of loopholes, this is exactly the sort of case we can point to."
subject100,0," - agreed. astral plane taxing authorities can't be happy about the one-way stream of assets going from the pockets of genies to the bank accounts of lucky lamp-finders. it would be one thing if the money was eventually making its way back to the local astral plane economy, but unless you're spending that $1b on summoning and levelling up various astral guardians, the astral plane is losing out on some serious government revenue."
subject100,0," - ha. i was leaning more towards d amp;d (never played lol), but yes, a bit off-topic :)"
subject100,0," - it has been brutal that this sub has been civ vi speculation/recap for the past 2 weeks. i'm all for the articles, etc. that provide new info, but at this point its like 1% new info, 99% other stuff/wishful thinking."
subject100,0," - for venice, i'll typically annex at least 3 cses for the food routes. the 10% science penalty is easily counteracted by getting an extra +15 food to venice all game. its certainly not necessary, but i find that venice ends up with quite a few gms, since you can't stop your puppets from working merchant specialist slots. i'd rather use those gms on food trade routes than a flat 3k gold, especially since with venice, gold is never a problem (and until late-game, its easier to have more trade route slots than cities you can reach with caravan/cargo ship)."
subject100,0," - its cheesy because there are no real repercussions, there's no downside. and its basically impossible for the cs to stop. you are right that you can't ally a cs when you do it. but in reality, you weren't going to secure a cs ally at turn 20 anyways. you don't have the gold to buy them off, and at best there was a barbarian camp to give you some influence. so there is really no downside there. further, there's no real military risk. cses have so few units at that point, and cses won't chase you out of their territory. so if you understanding healing and using terrain, there's a zero percent chance you lose your warrior. so again, no downside. i'd much rather just have every game start with a worker rather than having to cheese game mechanics for a free one."
subject100,0," - you're exactly right. you need to plop your city somewhere that has enough production to actually get petra built first. typically, you will drop the city somewhere effective, and send 2-3 food routes for a quick population boost (so you can work more tiles). other people use the great engineer from the liberty finisher to rush petra."
subject100,0," - sometimes, when the geography/map layout works out, you can end up creating a nice buffer state between you and the militaristic enemy. that way, if the opponent wants to attack again, he likely has to go the long way around (making defense easier), or he has to wipe out this weak civ again (getting him warmonger penalties = you can get other ais to denounce him)."
subject100,0," - it just leads to some of the better stories/recaps. its much easier to win with a 4-city tradition science turtle, but those games (and the path to victory) have been discussed ad nauseum. domination victories, though, you have a much more epic feel, where you're fighting off waves of unit carpets (while usually at a tech disadvantage). further, game-to-game, the path to victory will feel different because you are interacting much more with the ai civs, whereas with science turtles, you are mostly interacting with how to min-max city growth and science mechanics."
subject100,0," - venice is excellent at domination victory as well as diplomatic. they can do decently well at cultural if the map isn't huge (because they they really struggle to reach all of the civs). they are pretty good at science, but struggle a bit late game, since your population is so much lower than if you had a traditional 4-city tall civ. all around, they're a very strong civ on all difficulties in single player, though a bit more start-dependent than most. in multiplayer, you really shouldn't win unless your friends are being too nice. if you face venice, you should spend all game pillaging trade routes and keeping them crippled."
subject100,0,"civ vii list of demands - civ vi speculation was fun, but i'm already excited for civ vii, and here's how we can make it great: -move to 2.5 upt. the ai clearly can #8217;t figure out how to maximize corps/armies, and its too easy to exploit infantry/jeep/tesla coil stacks once you research the phonograph. -map trading! -rework in-game code so to avoid the game crashing once the ais start to build zeppelins. i #8217;m surprised this sub-reddit recovered after we lost the 128-civ br mk. v 400 turns in. -rework in-game code to allow the ai to move and shoot in the same turn. -ti-83 backwards compatability. -canals in the base game, not dlc. paying an extra $15 just to build canals was brutal. -wonders to add: disneyland (florida, not california); palace of versailles; fallingwater; blue domed church; mannekin pis. -tetrahedral tiles. i think we can all agree that using a robinson map projection just isn #8217;t lifelike. tetrahedral means we can play on winkel-tripel maps, which makes the game infinitely more realistic. -civs to add: rednecks (deep south); cockney england; hobbits (bag end); russian siberian (gulag era); weeaboo; gap-year europeans backpacking across asia and australia; cylon. -functional multiplayer. -buff opening honor. -remove the coldstone creamery victory condition. it encourages too much turtling late-game. -reduce diplomatic penalties for chem-trailing your own civilians. -districts were a good idea, but revise some. red light district led to many civ vi strategy guides blocked by company/university firewalls. and too much nsfw user art/memes... -edm baba yetu background music just didn #8217;t work. add your own requests/thoughts!"
subject100,0," - recent patches have fixed the 'science overflow' that used to let you abuse bulbing multiple scientists in a row. there's nothing to be careful about now though. the general strategy is to plant 2-3 scientists, and then save all your scientists until you unlock and build research labs in all your cities. then, 8 turns later, bulb them all to maximize science gained."
subject100,0, - american actually. i'm curious about why my word choice implied australian though.
subject100,0, - time to build the 'people's front of judea' modded civ!
subject100,0," - ais will almost never offer a fair trade for their last copy of a luxury. its poor programming in the game. for a duplicate luxury, expect to spend 7 gpt. the ai typically values strategic resources as 1-2 gpt, regardless of what era you are in. so you can cheese things a little bit by selling your horses during the industrial era, for instance."
subject100,0," - i don't think you can. random personalities is fun, but it can lead to certain ai doing very poorly, because the personality traits don't correspond to that civ's advantages. imagine the incas getting a low 'build roads preference,' or korea getting a low 'science preference.' i could easily see in your game, the celts getting a low 'religion preference' and not maximizing their ability to get an early religion."
subject100,0," - i think they win a game, but last night didn't give me hope for a close series. love and tristan thompson just aren't going to do what adams, ibaka and kanter did."
subject100,0," - the hardest parts of deity are 1. catching up on science, and 2. matching military production. one city means your population is inevitably going to be lower, meaning your total science is lower. one city also means you can't produce a military while you build up infrastructure elsewhere. so you've just made the 2 biggest deity challenges even harder. i haven't had the problem of crap spawns, but maybe try 'luxurious start' or whatever, to avoid the frustration of re-rolling 20 times?"
subject100,0," - settling on a hill where possible is a good idea (you get a free 1 production in your city). but settling location is always about weighing trade-offs. for instance, if you settle on a hill but as a result you don't get to be next to a mountain or on a river, it might not be worth the extra production. yes, growth is king. you need happiness/luxuries to support new cities, but you want to settle cities on spots where you can grow. meaning don't settle on tundra or desert tiles unless you have some other method of making the city large (eg, petra or religious beliefs)."
subject100,0," - i raze the city unless it has 1. a unique lux and is also in a good spot (ie, plenty of growth, not surrounded by jungle), 2. a good natural wonder and is also in a good spot, or 3. in an important strategic area (ie, a bridge connecting 2 continents, or a canal city). otherwise raze. warmongering still matters because if you don't respect diplomacy, you will find yourself in a scenario where the whole world is at war with you all game. on lower difficulties, it might not matter much, but on higher difficulties, it can mean that your domination is slowed down while someone else wins a cultural/science victory. this is especially true on large or huge maps."
subject100,0," - the only way to run the mod is if you install windows on your mac using bootcamp, or something similar. as a fellow mac user, it stinks."
subject100,0," - right before civ6 goes on sale or some time this summer, civv will probably cost $5usd on a steam sale. grab it then."
subject100,0," - true. which is why, during domination, you typically only capture the enemy's capital and 2-3 best cities. if you leave the crappy tundra cities alive, you reduce your warmonger score, and you don't get the increased penalty of completely wiping out a civ."
subject100,0," - i play marathon because i like my games to feel epic. i'm building an empire that is spanning the world. it should take more than 45 minutes. i also like to play on larger maps (large/huge), and on quick speeds you just can't meaningfully interact with everyone on maps that size."
subject100,0," - science is directly linked to population. so focus on growing your cities as large as possible: settle in places where you can build farms (preferably on rivers). use internal trade routes to boost food. prioritize food buildings over other military/defense/culture/gold. keep your happiness up, so that you avoid the negative happiness growth penalties."
subject100,0," - oracle is consistently available, even on the highest difficulties, so much so that you rarely need to 'rush' it. ais don't suffer the same penalties as the human player does. so the ai can have no money in its treasury, have a negative gpt, and still run its empire as usual."
subject100,0," - if there is a runaway, i'll usually go after them once i unlock artillery. the ai is bad at countering it, so you can capture a few cities pretty easily with minimal investment. 4-5 infantry/tank units, plus 3-4 artillery, and you'll be able to do some serious damage to the enemy civ. alternatively, if the ai is mostly coastal, do the same at frigates. 5-6 frigates plus a caravel or privateer to capture cities, will let you dominate the seas. you don't need to completely wipe out the ai, but if you raze (or capture and donate to other civs) 25% of his cities and wipe out his military, you'll set him back quite a bit."
subject100,0," - i run it on a 2010 macbook. it runs fine on low graphics settings, with animations disabled. i play marathon/huge maps, and it takes a few minutes to open the game and create a new map, but once you are playing it is fine. late-game sometimes turns get slow, but not too bad. expansions are definitely worth it."
subject100,0," - austria! well, then. g'day mate! let's put another shrimp on the barbie!"
subject100,0," - i sometimes do it if i want to play wide more easily. just keep in mind that some civs (siam, venice, austria, huns (or mongols, i can never keep them straight)) really benefit from city-states, so expect them to be less effective. you also make diplomatic victory much less likely, because total votes to win is a function of # of ai civs and # of city-states. so fewer city states means more ai votes needed to win, and its nearly impossible to get ais to vote for you."
subject100,0," - i don't know of any mod, but unfortunately you need to use manual specialist control. otherwise expect those filthy great merchant points..."
subject100,0, - i used the historic eras mod a few months ago and had no problems with other mods. i didn't use the community patch though.
subject100,0," - i think 'standard' games involve using the default number of city-states, and just work around the lack of space. most deity games involve only having 4 cities and going tradition, so you typically don't need that much space, and the city-states can be a nice buffer between you and the other ais."
subject100,0," - i think it has to do with the age/historical aspect of the natural wonders. the grand mesa had spiritual significance to native american tribes. everest, while far more impressive, wasn't really explored until very recent in human history."
subject100,0," - each new city is going to increase your tech costs and policy costs by 5%. i don't know of a hard and fast rule, but some simple math gives some insight into whether a new city is a good idea. if pottery costs 100 science with 1 city, it will cost 105 science with 2 cities. therefore, if your new city produces 5 science over the course of the game, its a net positive. the flip side is easier: imagine you've researched everything except the internet. the internet is 8,800 science on standard speed. if you built a city right when you began researching it, the internet now costs an extra 440 science. chances are, that single new city isn't going to produce 440 science before you end the game, so its a negative. of course, each illustration is way too simple, since a. there are about 10 techs per era, not just 1 single tech in the game, and b. each era, the tech cost increases (doubles, triples, quadruples, depending on the era), and c. the amount of science a city produces increases over time, and is affected by somewhat unpredictable factors, like population growth, timing of policies, great scientist points, etc. so its hard enough to figure out how much science a city will produce in its lifetime, let alone how much of a science penalty you need to offset. the usual assumption is that if you build a city before the renaissance era, and you build all the science buildings generally as soon as possible, the city will be a net benefit. alternatively, if you are building late-era cities, you will be slowing down your scientific growth. however, a key caveat: sometimes science growth is not the be-all, end-all reason for making a decision. if you need a late city to secure key resources, or for military operations, or you need to take a rival's capital, it might make sense to suffer the science/culture penalty for the greater good. if you want to figure out exact numbers, this page gives you the info you need (http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_technologies_in_civ5). i'm sure some sort of excel spreadsheet would be possible, but frankly given all the variables (are you going from 4 cities to 5, or 10 cities to 11; what science buildings do you have; what policies do you have), it would be a ton of work for info that you don't really need to achieve victory. same answer for culture, just different terms."
subject100,0," - no way. first, cities settled late in the game are not going to produce enough science and culture. second, cities that are in terrible locations (like tundra or desert cities) won't grow large enough (or at all), and their science/culture output will be low."
subject100,0," - ok, but you said ""always."" not trying to be pedantic, but lots of people reading/asking questions are newbies who wouldn't know even what a good spot is, or what 'enough space' is, or that late game settling is a bad idea."
subject100,0," - that's why the fastest science victories involve dropping new cities all the time and going super-wide, right? /s. by the very end of the game, that city founded in the 1900 might get up to 5% of your total science output. might. but you're ignoring that from 1900 to say 2050, every tech was 5% more expensive while your fledgling one-pop city contributed basically nothing to science output and you had to rush-buy science buildings and you had to feed the new city with trade routes. final total science output isn't the right metric to be looking at. you need to be looking at aggregate science produced over the course of the city's life. i'm not saying that late settling or going wide doesn't have its justifications or that its always a bad idea, but neither strategy is going to maximize how quickly you research technologies."
subject100,0, - you pay for roads in unclaimed territory.
subject100,0, - correct.
subject100,0," - honestly you're probably just bad at road building. it takes some practice, but if you manually build roads (and never use build to destination) it isn't too bad. you just need to figure out how crossroads work with hexagonal tiles. to your main question, civ vi roads are completely different. roads get built when you send a trade caravan from city a to city b. the ai will control where the roads go."
subject100,0," - are you selling luxuries you don't need? extra gold can be used to fund research agreements. similarly, you can gift luxuries to become friends with ais, and then once friends, get ras. which policies are you taking? if you have +30 happiness, you can avoid policies/tenets that give happiness and instead are helpful elsewhere. at the end of the game, once you've completed your tenet, chances are you'll be way above what you need for happiness. there's nothing wrong with that, and just enjoy the few extra golden ages you get as a result."
subject100,0," - not 100% sure, but i think its the only way to build roads in the earlier eras."
subject100,0," - its going to feel 'less casual' at launch no matter what, because we won't have 5+ years of theorycrafting, best practices, guides, etc. like we do for civ 5. but every civ game has been able to be played casually on some level of difficulty, and nothing i've seen in the previews so far suggests civ 6 will be different."
subject100,0," - keep in mind that you don't have to go to war alone to stop someone from snowballing. use diplomacy to build a coalition against a leader. pay your other neighbors to start a war, then go in with your 3-4 units and raze everything and capture every worker. usually that alone is enough to slow down a snowball, since they will spend the rest of the era rebuilding infrastructure."
subject100,0, - its almost like the growth and production mechanics might be different.
subject100,0," - it can, but not necessarily. if you declare war, you will likely cancel any outstanding trade routes and any open border arrangements. both of those contribute to that civ's tourism over you. this makes it easier for your culture to catch back up to the ai's tourism. the more likely scenario though, is if you capture and/or raze several key cities during the war, you will hopefully significantly reduce the ai's tourism points (either through great works or other tourism-providing buildings and wonders). again, this lets your culture catch back up. going to war against a cultural leader is a good way to ensure it can't get a cultural victory."

subject100,0," - one thing to keep in mind. in the early game, when you aren't using the academy very much, its a good idea to leave it unconnected in a corner of your city. then build a footpath to it if you need to create a spell for an event quest, for instance."
subject100,0," - its not just about being pro. if you're in a fellowship that's small, or full of low-activity levels, you suffer in a few ways: 1. your fellowship mates probably aren't visiting you a ton. that means lost gold and supplies from visits, and it means less culture or longer build times. 2. your fellowship won't do very well in tournaments. that means not as many relics (which means less goods production), fewer kp, fewer spells, fewer runes for ancient wonders. unfortunately, there's lots about this game that isn't explained very well (like which wonders are useful, or how to organize your city, or how to fight effectively). being in a more advanced fellowship means you can find people who can be more helpful. those lower ranked players might have the knowledge base (especially if its someone's second or third city), but its a lot less likely."

subject100,0," - try this test. forge your 10 broken shards into a rune for an aw. now your wheel is empty. then collect the greyed shards. does that work? also, let's have a little bit of perspective. you missed out on 1 round of production from your free event building (out of a possible 50). so the building was 2% less valuable than you expected? and again, the building was probably an after-thought prize from some other event, meaning you didn't pay money for it. so you lost 2% of the value of a free building. and that means inno is scamming the ill, sick and old? again, hyperbole much?"

subject100,0," - as long as you're not running alone with headphones in pitch black at night, pretty much everywhere in waltham is safe to run. most of the city has okay sidewalks (about as good as any other suburb). your starting location matters. waltham is a big city, and if you live by brandeis, good routes near the belmont/watertown line won't help much. the riverwalk/charles river is really the only place i'd call a ""route."" you could also go to the minuteman bike path in lexington center. its a short drive from many spots in waltham. otherwise its just make-it-up as you go along, as you find streets/neighborhoods that you like to run through. some suggestions: -plan routes that incorporate some of the main roads (main st., trapelo rd., lexington st., totten pond rd.) gives you some nice long stretches of decent sidewalk. then branch off those streets into random neighborhoods, or connect them. waltham has very little foot traffic (compared to say cambridge or somerville), so its actually not bad running down main st. past city hall; you'll have the sidewalk mostly to yourself (vs. running through harvard sq., where you'd be weaving through lots of other pedestrians). -if you like trail running, the western greenway is very good. it feels very remote at times, but you're rarely more than an 1/8th of a mile from a main road or a populated area. https://walthamlandtrust.org/the-western-greenway/ -the universities (bentley and brandeis) aren't sprawling, so you won't be able to knock out 5 miles like you might running around a place like wellesley, but they have some good space and are very low car traffic, so you can use the campus as a base and build off it with loops through nearby neighborhoods. especially a run around brandeis plus mt feake cemetary and the cedarwood neighborhood. -if you want a hill workout, prospect hill is quite the climb. it also has an ok trail system if you want to branch off and not just go straight up-and-down. -there are some public tracks that are almost always available and not crowded (bentley, leary field). those are probably your best bet for ""safe,"" but not everyone wants to run 5 miles on a track. happy to provide more detail if you give a sense of what mileage you're looking for, time of day you run, and general starting area. if you don't use it already, getting familiar with a site like gmap-pedometer.com to plan mileage is crucial."

subject100,0,"preferred ""premium"" website - i've been playing fantasy for over a decade, but this year with kids, work, etc., i don't feel like i can do my normal draft prep and mid-season waiver tracking. i'm also at the point of my life where spending $50-100 to make fantasy football more fun is money well spent. so i wanted to see what premium content folks rely on, and why. the only ""premium"" site i have a good sense of is rotopass (courtesy of a few thousand ads while listening to the matthew berry podcast over the years). i'm mostly focused on mid-season help, since the draft tools around here are really top-notch (especially thanks to /u/elboberto and /u/beer4thebeergod). but something with good season previews and draft strategy discussions would be great too, as i've got a few leagues, and they all have very different structures and scoring systems. caveat: i assume this isn't violating rule 8. if it is, apologies mods. also, a question i've always wondered. what's the difference between r/ff and r/f_f. is there some kind of rivalry?"
subject100,0," - do you know your plans post-law school? i think the answer impacts the decision. if you plan on going into biglaw (or even mediumlaw) and reasonably expect a salary north of $160k for 3+ years after graduation, or if you're going directly to the business world (like your current employer), don't bother worrying about your loan amounts. you will be able to pay back your loans easily with even a moderate amount of budgeting. and budgeting is really easy when you're billing 2k+ hours a year. you just don't have a ton of time to spend it on leisure. if you plan on going into public interest/government, or looking into something with less guaranteed income (either a start-up, or a boutique firm that isn't on the ""cravath"" associate salary track), then consider reducing your total loan amount with that extra $1k/month. after hls, with these kinds of jobs, you might not have enough cash on-hand to pay down some of the higher interest loans quickly. so you're much more likely to be paying a lot of the interest on the law school loans. whereas in the first case, you're likely only paying interest on law school loans for 3-4 years (and depending on biglaw bonuses, maybe less). in the first case, i think having some extra cash in your pocket during law school and leading up to law school can be a really nice thing. it might mean you splurge on an apartment closer to campus. or you go out to drinks with classmates a bit more regularly to keep your sanity. or you have more money available to pursue hobbies or take a trip. law school at a t15 (and moreso at h/y/s) is as much a test of perseverance and discipline as it is a test of your ability to understand the content. this is pure speculation, but i'd bet the majority of people who don't excel at a t15 are for mental health reasons. so do what you can to reduce the likelihood that stress and anxiety impact your scholastic performance. i'm basing this on what i personally experienced and saw from a lot of my cohort. i graduated from t5 in the late 2000s with $150k debt, and worked for amlaw50 in a major city."
subject100,0," - biglaw is definitely daunting and not for everyone. but for a junior attorney, its really not that bad. its a lot of hours and stress, but its not so bad if you've already a. did well enough undergrad to get into hls, b. are professional enough and smart enough to have landed a job at tech company at 100k+, and c. (in a few years) made it through hls 1l year. plus the money is good enough and more importantly the training is good enough that even on the worst days its ""good enough."" and if you know you want to get out in a few years (like i did), its much easier to let the stress/bs roll off your back, compared to your classmates that want to make partner. anyways, best of luck! you're in a good position for your career, and you should be proud of your success so far!"

subject100,0," - priest holmes wasn't exactly a dud with the ravens, or a benchwarmer as you describe. he put up a 1,000 yard season in 1998, and had a 200 yard game. he was going to be the starter but got hurt in 1999 (if i remember correctly), and he mostly left baltimore because future 2,000-yard rusher jamal lewis really excelled as a rookie in 2000 and helped carry the ravens to the superbowl. holmes definitely got better once he left for kc, but i think he had much more success with his first team than damien williams ever had with mia. i still agree with your underlying analysis that situation matters for damien williams; i just don't think priest holmes is a great example."
subject100,0," - some event buildings produce your boosted tier good ""+1"" or your boosted tier good ""+2."" this means that, if you're looking at elixir/dust/gems, and a building is ""tier good +1,"" you take your boosted tier (here gems) and move one to the right (here elixir - since once you get all the way to the right, you go back to the start of the row). if you had a +2 building, you would produce dust. not every building is +1 or +2. some are just flat goods producers, regardless of your particular boost. its nice to have the +1 or +2 because that way not everyone is producing the same good, and thus flooding the market. imagine a world where an event building only made marble. you can imagine that marble would become super over-produced. whereas if the event building was ""+1 tier 1 boosts,"" you'd have a much more equal distribution of tier 1 goods from that particular event building."
subject100,0," - any reason you put jacobs as ""less murky"" than some of the other mentions? curious, not combative."
subject100,0,"te strategy - i'm curious how people are going into drafts (real and mocks) thinking about tes. on one hand, most experts say: -draft best player available; -don't overdraft qb or te since you only need 1; and -some of the top tes are probably due for regression. so it feels like a reach to grab ertz or kittle early round 3 when i could be getting keenan allen, for instance. on the other hand, there's really not a lot of te depth, and i have a bad habit of losing matchups with rb/wr points sitting on my bench. are people who are spending their first 6-8 picks on rbs/wrs just comfortable that they'll make up the difference on te points elsewhere on their roster? i had great success with howard last year (had him in a handful of leagues) last year until he got hurt, so part of me just wants to go into each draft saying ""round 6 is spent on howard/engram, regardless."" generally curious how people are handling this. [reposted with less league setting detail to avoid the automod]"
subject100,0," - i like josh jacobs if only because every year there is a rookie rb that is the team's clear #1 that does well from a fantasy perspective. adp matters, of course, but if i'm picking at the end of a snake, and can get jacobs at the end of the 4th as my second rb, i'm probably happy. i'd probably rather have jacobs over some other rbs in that draft range, like henry."
subject100,0," - i don't think my strategy would change a ton. the only big difference is that there are now a few more late round rbs that can provide some serious value through their receptions (like tarik cohen, austin ekeler, james white), when they wouldn't have as much value in standard. so i guess knowing that you can get a late-round rb might make you more willing to reach for a top qb or te. i think the most important thing is to make sure your draft rankings list just includes ppr. in one of my less serious leagues, a lot of people just print off the espn 300 list, yet we are a ppr league. it doesn't make a huge difference, but there are a lot of players on the margin that have their adp adjusted if you were using a ppr ranking list."
subject100,0," - i'm finding a lot of hill and evans in my mocks, because i'm usually drafting 4-6 of 12 (meaning i get an rb with my first pick), so i typically see those guys coming back to me in round 2, and they're a good choice as late second rounders."
subject100,0," - i've been able to consistently get guys like vance mcdonald and david njoku, so i think we're drafting similarly. maybe i just have nightmares/suffering from recency bias from last year when i was streaming tes like jimmy graham and was getting crushed by teams with zach ertz."
subject100,0," - thanks. i initially posted most of my leagues were 12-teamers, and auto-mod deleted it. kelce in the 3rd would be great, but i'm seeing him go late first, early second in most of my mocks. but those are mocks for a reason, so come draft day, i'll definitely keep an eye out. definitely waiting on qb. goff, wentz, jimmy g, rivers, winston. so many options. i feel like this is the year every league should go 2qb :d"
subject100,0, - any concerns about all the other sf options being healthy? part of me wants a top te like ertz and kittle if only because they're fun to root for.
subject100,0," - the difference is approximately 0.5 points per reception :d again, its all in the rankings/adp changes. slot receivers and scat backs get a bit more valuable. deep-play guys like desean jackson and bulldozer rbs like derrick henry get less valuable."
subject100,0," - i mostly do live drafts and draft manually. i'll print out beersheets, elboberto's rankings, and the espn 300/yahoo 150 or whatever. i won't use the espn/yahoo sheets, but i'll keep them around because i find that a lot of other people use them, so they're useful for predicting who might get drafted in the coming picks."
subject100,0," - i'm seeing kerryon go mid-third. so let's play out what your team can look like if you pick 4th (in a 12-teamer). if chubb was there, you could have say kamara and chubb, then go wr/wr. so you might see something like thielen in the 3rd and cooks in the 4 (and the names don't matter - we're just talking general tiers). if you skip chubb, you might have kamara and evans as your second rounder, then kerryon in the 3rd and cooks in the 4th. you might prefer kamara/evans/kerryon/cooks to kamara/chubb/thielen/cooks, but what happens if kerryon goes earlier than expected (late 2nd or very early 3rd)? then you're probably getting mack or fournette, or reaching on freeman. not saying either is better or worse. just noting that i see a lot of chubb going mid-second, and i would be very happy to start my ppr draft with kamara/chubb."
subject100,0, - nice! that's the sort of pick that can win you your league (which is part of my hope when waiting on someone like mcdonald or njoku).
subject100,0," - just talking high-level strategy here. i don't like to go in ""knowing"" what my third round pick is going to be, because so much can happen in the first two rounds. even by your first pick, what if someone opts for adams/hopkins before dj, and you get dj at 8? at that point, i'd feel much better about rb. the other downside is that i'm guessing you have some rb and wr ""fliers"" you like in later rounds. if you dump the majority of your draft capital into rb, its hard to justify spending anything more on rb in later rounds. because if you aren't ""set"" at rb by that point, you're kind of boned. so then you're no longer taking ""best player available"" in later rounds, because rb is effectively off the board. now you're taking ""best wr"" available, and that might severely limit your ability to make ""good"" picks in rounds 7-10. as for specific picks/ranks, chubb as 1.8 in a 12-team .5ppr feels high. are the rankings you're using factoring in ppr scoring? because i'd expect to see at least 2-3 wrs off the board and kelce taken before chubb."
subject100,0, - plus let's not forget how few rbs even make it to week 10. major and minor injuries and suspensions will be a thing.
subject100,0," - i think we're on the same page? i'm not discounting chubb due to hunt, and i don't think you are either. there's just too much randomness in ff to worry about what might happen in late november."
subject100,0," - yeah, i was mostly saying that, when i'm drafting, i don't worry too much about ""down the road"" stuff. like i'll see posts about what a qb's matchups look like in week 14. its way too hard to predict, and taking something like estimated strength of schedule, or mid-season work flow, or how a guy looks returning from suspension, etc. etc. is just too variable. also, great username!"
subject100,0," - we do in-person drafts. in-person snake draft = 2-3 hours. in-person auction draft = 6-7 hours. at this point, all of us have kids and/or demanding jobs, so the time commitment to auction is a tough sell. i like auction format, but ""get the player you really want"" is really only relevant for the top 5-6 players. otherwise you can get anyone you want; you might just have to reach."
subject100,0," - amen to the downside of being ""on"" for so much longer during a draft. snake is a much more social experience."
subject100,0," - make sure your adp list matches your league scoring. there's a lot of lists that assume 10 teams, no ppr, qb/2rb/2wr/te/flex. so if you're in a 12-team ppr scoring with 2 flex spots or 3wrs, then that list needs to be adjusted. lots of good sites (and beersheets) do this; sites like espn/yahoo don't really."
subject100,0," - in a 16-round draft, usually by round 10. by that point, expected adp varies widely from player to player, and site to site. a guy with a round 11 adp can be going as high as round 8 for some experts, and as low as round 14 for others. so if you really want the guy, go get him, because someone else might like him as much and have a site that supports a higher adp."
subject100,0," - not really ""good"" or ""bad."" some considerations. its ""good"" because usually the first overall pick is awesome, and will be a solid backbone for your team. this is also a good year to pick first, because there's a bunch of guys that will be awesome, so you can't really go wrong if you pick saquon, kamara, etc. when you draft 1st, that means you get to pick 2 players in a row every time at the ""turn"" (meaning when the draft is at the end of round 2 and into round 3, and round 4 into round 5, etc). its ""good"" to take 2 players in a row because that means its easier to get the guys you ""want."" on the other hand, its bad because you need to be a lot more strategic about filling out positions, because in between your picks, there will be 20+ picks (depending on league size) between your set of picks."
subject100,0," - i probably wouldn't take it. as a first-timer, its kind of nice drafting first. you're probably going to have the best player in the league, and its a nice advantage in early rounds."
subject100,0," - its totally group-dependent. i have 1 snake group that i think would be a pretty good auction group. everyone is well prepared. but the group i do an auction with, after the top 25 guys go its: (someone spends 30 seconds researching who to nominate) then (the bid timer counts down with minimal action) then (someone realizes player x is a steal, so starts a bidding war) etc etc. auction draft is a ton of fun. those ""bid over the top"" moments or the tense bidding fights for prized sleepers are great drama and excitement. and the strategy of saving for sleepers, and figuring who's out of money is a ton of fun too."
subject100,0, - oh man. the years when there were 2 adrian petersons were goddamn high comedy for some of my auction leaguemates. and it was funny. but then add 30 minutes to every draft litigating the one guy who was tricked into spending $60 on adrian peterson (chi) and wants to unwind it.
subject100,0," - i think the ""auto-draft"" technology is pretty good; the downside is that yahoo at least drafts k/def waaaay too early. so the auto-drafters will likely have a good draft through the first 8-9 rounds, then the wheels will fall off when auto-draft grabs 2 qbs, 3tes and a kicker in round 13. but that's not the worst fate, since in reality, rb/wrs picked after round 10 are worse than lottery tickets."
subject100,0," - honestly, because experts ""say so."" which is why i pose the question to the broader group. your reasoning makes sense to me. i think the downside to ertz/kittle (less so kelce) is that both had historically great seasons, and i'd expect regression from both. but there's arguments that maybe they won't regress. but setting aside the wr/rb you pick instead of ertz in the 3rd, i think the thought process is: you need at least 3 good wrs and 3 good tes. and by round 10, anyone you're picking is a total crapshoot. marvin jones is there in round 9, but i don't want him as anything more than a flex. so if i have 9 picks to hit on 6 studs, taking one of those picks away to spend on a te just feels risky. maybe its different if you're consistently hitting late round picks, but that hasn't really been the case for me."
subject100,0," - very true. in my auction league, the last place punishment is that team buys a keg for the following year's draft. and since the keg gets finished, you can imagine that ""draft speed"" isn't much of a priority."
subject100,0," - i'm not discriminating against tes. this whole thread is based on ""expert advice"" that i hear on podcasts and see on fantasypros, etc. but you shouldn't treat tes like wrs, because you need 2-3 wrs in your starting lineup, and presumably 2 or so on the bench. so the ""value above replacement"" is different."
subject100,0," - well, its not common, but you could trade draft picks in snake. especially if you want to trade down. i'd think most people would be happy to take your first rounder for an extra 3rd and 5th (or whatever fair value is). ""get the players you want"" is a fallacy in and of itself. its really ""get a chance at the players you want,"" because you might get outbid on a player, or not have the funds left for that player (depending on bidding process). auction definitely makes it easier to ""get your guys,"" but its not a guarantee you get those guys."
subject100,0," - i think ""they always go for half a wr1"" is not true this year. i've seen kelce go for low $40s and kittle go for high $30s when top wr1s (adams, julio, hopkins) are going mid $50s. sure there's some discount, but there's also positional scarcity and value-above-replacement to consider too."
subject100,0," - just check your league rules. our league plays that you have to have a full roster at the end of the draft, to avoid this exact question."
subject100,0," - a lot of people subscribe to value based drafting, which means take the best player available. most places won't suggest going into a draft planning wr/wr or rb/rb. instead, the advice is to run a few mock drafts and see how your team plays. e.g., if you're picking 6 in a 12 team league, you could grab connor or hopkins. so try out a few mocks where you get connor, and try a few with hopkins. i find that my round 1 draft slot dictates a lot of rounds 2-4. a popular resource is beersheets. https://footballabsurdity.com/beersheet-request-form/. it takes your league settings, and shows you who is the best value at your current pick."
subject100,0," - is a 2wr or 3wr league? i'd be scared of going rb/rb/rb in a 3wr league. generally i think the strategy makes sense if you're getting value on the 3rd rb (which i think chubb around 3.04 is). the main risk i see is that you're basically committing to spending the next 3-4 picks on wrs, and you might be in a position where there aren't good wrs for where you are picking. so then you're either reaching, or filling out qb/te (and falling even further behind in wr). but absolutely could work out well."
subject100,0," - the only ""key"" to mastering ppr is to make sure the rankings you are using are based on ppr scoring. if you use espn 300 standard scoring rankings, you'll miss out on a lot of guys that are really only valuable in ppr (like tarik cohen), and you'll overvalue guys that aren't as good in ppr (like derrick henry). otherwise the draft ""strategy"" is still the same."
subject100,0," - been using yahoo for years. its not perfect, but its solid. haven't done nfl. used espn a few times and found it was trash. i found the interface painful to look at and not intuitive. haven't actually drafted on sleeper. only used it for mock drafts. it seems pretty good, but the app is brutal on alerts. last thing i need is 17 daily updates on potential 8th round picks. if there's a way to adjust the alerts to be ""just guys on my team"" or ""just waiver wire guys,"" then i'd like it alot more."
subject100,0, - pick up everyone's tab? that can get pricey with some drafts!
subject100,0, - agreed!
subject100,0," - citystreets is fine, especially if you get seated in the back area. the tapas place on moody (name escapes me) is also good, because its massive and never more than 1/3rd full. chateau."
subject100,0, - amen. its not total points missed out on. its points above replacement.
subject100,0," - i think this is interesting analysis, but i don't think just because picking kelce results in more expected points means that picking kelce is the optimal strategy. if that were true, you'd probably really have an optimal strategy of picking kelce and mahomes with your first two picks, because those two are going to really drive up the expected value of your starting lineup. but we all know that in practice, that strategy would have a really low likelihood of success, since you'd have no depth at rb or wr. again, not saying your conclusion is wrong, but i think its hard to say for everyone that you have to pick kelce at the tail of round 1 really makes sense. i think the better suggestion is ""if you are picking 12 of 12 in a ppr snake, run a few mocks where you always get kelce."" because everyone has different comfort levels with the various tiers of wrs and rbs."
subject100,0," - ""do you feel lucky?"""
subject100,0," - i think its 12%, but i'm not sure. i say that because 40% wouldn't really make sense if the only rbs left on the board were gordon, miller, and everyone below miller. or maybe put more clearly, it has to be 12% because otherwise these 2 scenarios would both have 40% rb scarcity, and that wouldn't make any sense: a. all rbs above gordon are drafted - gordon is the best rb left on the board. b. all rbs above miller are drafted, except gordon. if both scenarios had the same positional scarcity, then i'd argue that the scarcity number doesn't have any value. because you're describing 2 completely different scenarios with the same number."
subject100,0," - i'd be very happy with watkins at his current adp, especially when you consider that tyreek hill is riskier than most for off-the-field stuff. if i was happy with my first 2 wrs, i'd much rather have an upside guy like watkins, shepherd or kirk than a steady but unspectacular option like marvin jones. i think it comes down to what your first 6-8 picks look like."
subject100,0," - yahoo grades are the worst. they completely ignore your bench, and assume 100% health for all your players. so the guy with 3 kickers on his bench can get a better grade based on starters' project points than the guy who nabbed all the consensus must-have sleepers."
subject100,0," - lots of negative nancys here. you might not have the best experience, but you can still come away with a solid team. first, pay for seat upgrades to ""economy premium"" or whatever it is. i don't have any evidence, but i always find that my wifi works a little better in the nicer seats. second, you need to prepare for poor wifi with your yahoo rankings. this involves both pre-draft planning, and mid-draft finetuning. so you need to: a. rank all dsts and k all way, way down. otherwise, as mentioned elsewhere, autodraft will look to fill out your starting roster in round 8. b. rank all ""backup"" tes and qbs even further down. again, these are guys you want under no circumstances, and while most live drafters know that you don't usually want 2tes or 2qbs on your roster, yahoo dgaf. c. rank all your sleepers/late round targets pretty high. i don't know the exact sweet spot, because it depends on your league settings. but you want a good list of 15-20 guys that you want in say rounds 8-15. if you get stuck on auto-draft, you might end up having ""reached"" for some of your sleepers in round 10, but its preferable to having yahoo draft someone who's adp is wildly off ecr. then mid-draft, you need to be constantly fine-tuning your rankings, because you want to assume that at any point you could get kicked off. so if you just made your round 4 picks, and you're at rb/rb/te/wr, and you want to fill out wr, then find 5-6 round 5ish wrs and put them on your draft queue. the part of all of this that sucks is that yahoo makes this ranking re-adjustment relatively tedious. one other suggestion. this strategy is a little easier if you're picking at the turns, because you are reducing the windows of time where you need to have good connectivity. which naturally reduces the likelihood that its your pick and you're offline. so if your draft position is in anyway flexible, you might want your leaguemates to do you a solid and find a draft spot at the turns."
subject100,0," - i think the consensus is that washington is going to be bad. expected to be in the bottom 6 of the league. one of their 2 strengths (o-line, the other being their front 7) is a major question mark with trent williams holding out and threatening to never play (for was) again. so you have a bellcow back that is going to be on a bad offense for a team that's best chance of winning is to play slugfest and hope their defense wins out. i think he's a good pick because he will get touches. but i am not sure if there's a high likelihood that he explodes into a player that you happily slot into rb1 each and every week."
subject100,0," - i don't think either spot results in a significantly better team. i think it comes down to ""do you want to pick 2 players in a row at the turn"" or conversely, is there someone you really want at 7 that might not be there at 8? otherwise trying to predict much further down the road in a draft is too speculative."
subject100,0," - josh gordon if he's re-instated. any rb handcuff, really. pick an rb in a top-scoring offense that's already dinged up or possibly holding out (zeke, gurley, mack), and then find the next guy on the depth chart (pollard, jackson, d'onta foreman). jack doyle. qbs like cousins, prescott, trubisky, allen. bunch of good wrs, like albert wilson, mo sanu, adam humphries. some of these guys could excel especially in ppr."
subject100,0," - i don't disagree. but if the wifi router (or whatever a plane uses) is at the front of the plane, wouldn't seats closer to the front get better service? not saying the router is at the front of the plane, and i agree what i said was entirely anec-data."
subject100,0," - well, its auction, so there's no ""rounds."" what you mean is should you spend more of your budget on a qb. i think short answer is 'no.' 6pts per td make rushing qbs slightly less valuable, but overall it doesn't make qb vs. other positions substantially more important. the important thing is to get an auction calculator that you can use based on your league's settings, like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/clwm63/elbobertos_custom_auction_value_generator_2019/"
subject100,0," - following up with the link, since i just shared it elsewhere: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/clwm63/elbobertos_custom_auction_value_generator_2019/"
subject100,0," - yeah, this seems like a dumb rule. it just makes the best tes even better, and then makes mid-tier tes closer to high-end wrs."
subject100,0, - i think part of the benefit of the air raid offense is that the o-line doesn't need to block for as long.
subject100,0,"history of qb adp vs qb production - i've heard several podcasts discuss why you generally want to wait on qbs. highly drafted qbs rarely end up finishing where they were drafted, etc. has anyone compiled this data for the last few years? e.g. a list for each qb of: adp; total points; total points rank; points per game; ppg rank?"
subject100,0,"noqb/note snake draft strategy - what does ""wait on qb/te"" mean to you? - curious to hear how people that are waiting on qb and/or waiting on te approaching the draft. i see a few options, with the obvious caveats of taking best player available (if i'm waiting on te, but kelce is available at 3.01, i'm taking him), and i'd love to hear how other people's drafts are playing out: 1. ""wait"" and grab the tail end of the qb1s and te1s. so for qb, that's getting someone like cam/carson/kyler in the 8th or 9th, and for te getting hooper/walker in the 9th or 10th. -in some respects, this doesn't feel like ""waiting,"" but instead it feels like being comfortable with some of the tail end qbs and tes. i'm torn on this strategy, because a lot of experts don't see much difference in the top 12 qbs and the top 20 qbs. and at te, guys like walker feel like ""high floor/low ceiling"" guys, and i might be foregoing a valuable handcuff or rookie rb flier in the 10th round. on the other hand, it definitely meshes more with my general goal of ""get the best player available."" 2. truly wait, and fill out the last 4 roster spots (prior to dst/k with your last 2 picks) with the 2 best qbs and the 2 best tes. so spend rounds 1-10 grabbing rbs and wrs, and starting in round 11, go some form of qb1/te1, qb1/te1, qb2/te2, qb2/te2, dst, k. -on one hand, this actually doesn't feel too risky, since you could have the choice of guys like jimmy g and lamar jackson at qb, and trey burton and jordan reed at te. on the other hand, you're spending 2 bench spots making sure that you have good backups at qb and te so you can better handle your streaming options. i suppose the bench spots aren't as important if you've spent nearly all of your draft capital on wrs and rbs. 3. same as #2, but don't hedge with 2 qbs and 2 tes. if its a 16-round draft, working backwards, you grab k last, dst in r15, te in r14, qb in r13. then you're sitting on gobs of wrs and rbs. -i don't think i have enough comfort in picking a good te or qb that late in the draft. but maybe the idea is to trust the math that qb12 off the board isn't too far off qb18? or just approach the season with a lot more waiver wire flexibility to dump the qb/te that isn't working for you, knowing that most people will be spending waiver priority on rbs and wrs? so those who are also aiming on ""waiting,"" what do you expect your draft results to look like? i think league mechanics are also important to take into account. i think a waiting strategy assumes in part that some of those excess rbs and wrs you store up on will be trade bait down the road, and some leagues just don't see a lot of trades. similar, some leagues i've been in have a lot of guys who want a backup qb in the 10th, even if they spend a 4th rounder on rodgers. a terrible idea, of course, but it also means that, if i'm waiting on qb, one more solid qb is off the board. assume qb/2rb/2wr/te/flex/dst/k, with 5 or 6 bench spots. i think the analysis above is probably valid for 10 or 12 team leagues."
subject100,0," - so if you really want vance, do you feel the need to reach up for him? because if he's your last ""good"" te, do you worry at all that someone else in the draft will grab him?"
subject100,0," - i haven't played point per receiving first down, but i wouldn't love the stat just as a casual stat tracker. if i watch the espn ticker, and i see ""adams: 4 catches, 85 yards, td,"" i have a good sense of how many points he's scored. if there's only points per first down receptions, now i don't. i already hate people half-watching football glued to their phones getting near-constant score updates. points per receiving first down would only make it worse. other key point - 'points per receiving first down' doesn't have a nice acronym. which is in my mind a perfectly good reason to poo-poo pprfd."
subject100,0," - this exact reason is why i love /u/elboberto's calculator: https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/cqz10x/elbobertos_custom_auction_value_generator_2019/ for keepers, i take his generator, plug in my league settings, and plug in the kept players at their auction price. it then shows you how much each position and each player is affected by a particular keeper. very helpful."
subject100,0, - good points all around so far. one thing to consider is maybe expanding roster sizes. like play 3wr instead of 2wr. or play 2qb and 2flex spots.
subject100,0," - check whether ir counts the same as suspension. if so, look at josh gordon (i assume he's suspended?) or golden tate. otherwise someone like jerrick mckinnon?"
subject100,0," - if anything, come up with point systems that boost other positions too. throw in points per completions for qbs; points for 100yard games or points per first down (helps rbs but arguably helps wrs/tes more)."
subject100,0, - i think keepers works best with auction drafts. it sounds like you're doing keepers with a snake draft?
subject100,0," - nta. its a tournament. the point is to win. if this person is feeling demoralized midway through the match, they can always concede the rest of the match and walk away."
subject100,0,"what do you do with your stuff? - kind of a meta post, but curious about what people do with their stuff when renovating their homes. we're doing a basement reno next year, and our basement is currently storage for all our random crap/holiday effects/etc. options include: move everything to the attic and other rooms; pods and other on-site storage; dump stuff at my parents; off-site long-term storage; work around it; channel marie kondo and throw it all out. thoughts from the renovation experts?"
subject100,0," - for the top rbs, i don't think .5ppr really changes much. because most of those top rbs are also pass-catchers (with the exception of maybe nick chubb - but even he has lots of stories about how he will catch more passes since duke johnson got traded). i would say go wr/rb this year not because of the .5ppr change, but just because i don't love 2 of the rbs that will likely be there when you pick 1.10 and 2.1. you'd be picking 2 of some mix of bell, connor, gurley, cook, mixon, chubb. no thanks, imo. i'd be pretty happy going chubb and wr (likely julio, obj, mike thomas) vs rb/rb."
subject100,0," - i've been liking 5th/6th in the 12 teamers i do. it depends a little bit on your comfort level with zeke, but picking 5/6 means you either get zeke or hopkins/adams as your first pick, and then coming back around you get either someone like mike evans at wr or dalvin cook/joe mixon at rb. its a bit of a cop-out, but i actually think this year, for 12-team leagues, there's really no bad spot to pick. because even at 8-9, when you're either getting the first of the second tier rbs (like bell and connor, neither of whom i like), you can just punt and go wr. it seems like there's a lot less of a cliff at rb/wrs in the first 5ish rounds, so you can be flexible and pick up the guys you like, without worrying as much about position."
subject100,0," - eagles and browns are good picks. i also like the broncos. tough division, but they've been spending a lot of resources on defense, and they hired fangio, who is great. i think the seahawks and ravens won't be great necessarily (neither have the talent they had in years past), but if they're really going to run the ball 75 times a game (slight exaggeration), it should mean that total yards and scoring are kept down. maybe not a high upside team, but also not going to get you the dreaded negative points."
subject100,0," - did you shop around a lot for pod-like companies? seems like in my area there are a half-dozen or so pod-style offerings. i suspect i'd just pick one on price, but i'm curious if there's other things to be thinking about, like convenience of delivery/customer service experience."
subject100,0, - oh it will be. i'm very excited to have a dumpster in my driveway for a month or two. paint cans from 10 years ago? gone. random garden tools from the previous owner? gone. whichever kid is being the mouthiest that week? gone.
subject100,0," - i am in the same boat, with an unused bagster sitting around. great idea for fall leaf cleanup!"
subject100,0," - agreed that pods seem expensive. if i needed a pod for a few months, seems like it would be cheaper to just buy a cheapo shed from home depot and then donate/craigslist it when i'm done."
subject100,0, - that's a good idea. half of the basement (or close to it) will be storage.
subject100,0," - we do this, except instead of #6, its ""most points that isn't already in the playoffs."" keeps things interesting for the team that maybe went 0-4 to start the season but somehow is also #1 in total points scored (and likely #1 in most points against)."
subject100,0," - to piggyback on this thread of really good questions, you need to ask ""what do i want to do"" in the next 5-10 years, and then ask whether an mba helps achieve that. from this post, it seems like your current job doesn't require an mba, so you would probably not be getting a good return on your time and money if you did an mba and stayed at your current job. if there's a specific career path, industry or job that you'd love to have, and an mba would help, then i think further analysis is worth it. if you're looking to keep options open more generally, then i think getting an mba just to get one probably won't be worth it. this is /pf, so there's a big focus on money (and rightly so), but keep in mind that there's real social costs to an mba program. if you do part-time/nights, that's a big hit to your social life/sports and exercise/etc. if you do it full-time, then you're pulling yourself out of the workforce for awhile."
subject100,0," - i think its dumb, honestly. it guts wrs, since wrs never run (compared to qbs running, or rbs catching passes), and when they do, its a fluke. you can't pat yourself on the back because you knew when you drafted julio that he'd score on a jet sweep in week 4. it also doubly punishes non-receiving rbs, since you say its already ppr. its also silly to pretend that an rb catching the ball is somehow ""out of position."" i'm not one of those guys who thinks that fantasy scoring's first priority should be to create a system where the best nfl players are the best fantasy players, but i also think that it should be somewhat of a priority. the flip side is that if you're in a half dozen ""regular"" leagues and this one is just for kicks, and for experimenting, more power to you. not my cup of tea, but that doesn't make it wrong."
subject100,0," - one downside - seems like automod is way too overbearing on posts that mention ""round"" or ""adp"" or draft position. so if automod cools its jets a bit, it might be easier to get your idea to gain traction."
subject100,0," - amen re: waivers. i think the important question to ask former champs is ""how many of your draft picks started during your ff playoffs?"" its usually a surprisingly low %"
subject100,0,"3wr leagues and best player available - i'm curious how people drafting in 3wr leagues (especially larger leagues like 12-teamers) that draft best player available deal with their rbs. i'm finding in my mocks, when i'm picking #6 or later (and missing out on the top 4 rbs), its really hard to justify an rb at his adp until like round 5 or 6. and usually kelce in the mid-2nd is a no-brainer. for instance, beersheets and other ranking resources have late 2nd/early 3rd wrs (brown, evans) as much more valuable that mid 2nd rbs (gurley, chubb). it might be an issue with yahoo/espn mocks being not terribly useful, but are people embracing zero rb more in 3wr leagues?"
subject100,0," - thanks, this is super-helpful. i may need to move my mocks to sleeper (though i'm having trouble with the app), because yahoo mocks have some of those rbs going much higher. my brain tells me that your draft is more representative, but i just did a mock where i went adams/kelce/wr/wr (because those were hands-down the best options), and then the best rb i could get was white in the 5th. again, my brain says ""that's fine - rb value is depressed if you have kelce and 4 good starting wrs,"" but my fantasy football gut says ""james white is your rb1? puke"""
subject100,0," - so you still draft rbs high (and maybe even above their ""value"") and focus on wrs in later rounds? do you do this even if you're picking late, and your first rb might be someone like bell or gurley? because it scares the hell out of me to go something like bell/cook if i'm picking late, then having a bunch of high-upside wrs, but no studs."
subject100,0," - i think that makes sense. i guess my problem is that i'm finding pretty quickly that say all the tier 3 rbs are gone when there's still tier 2 wrs. so i grab the wr. then we get to tier 4 rbs, and still tier 3 wrs exist. etc etc. so i'm getting kelce and 4 wrs, and by then my first rb is someone like kenyan drake. have you done mocks with this league structure?"
subject100,0," - awesome, thanks! yahoo's lack of mock draft options is really frustrating at times."
subject100,0," - good point about the late rounders. this league does have a decent bench, so if i can get 4-5 ""lottery ticket"" rbs, at least one should hit, right? :d"
subject100,0," - thanks. i usually like mid-round picks, but this league i would have loved picking #1-3. i feel like getting kamara/barkley/cmc would have helped a lot with this dilemma. i agree re: t.y. he is going to be better than people expect with brisset."
subject100,0," - thanks. i like that strategy. i also like to punt on te, but i'm finding a lot of mocks have kelce available mid-second when i'm picking. and its just too tempting..."
subject100,0," - thanks. did you reach up to get justin jackson? i kind of like the idea of gordon/ekeler/jackson. its a lot of draft capital, but it ensure you're getting the rb production of a solid offensive team."
subject100,0," - one of the upsides of this league is that its all guys on a flag football team, so we're around each other alot. i find that we end up with way more trades than normal, so i'm comfortable having wr depth on my bench, knowing i can get something for it. probably not an rb1, but maybe a qb upgrade, or some help at rb2."
subject100,0," - i like gurley too. i wouldn't get him before the top wrs like hopkins and adams, though. i'd be happy if he fell to me in mid-round 2."
subject100,0," - yeah, it wouldn't be the worst thing to have james white and tarik cohen as my rbs, if i'm spending the first 5 picks on kelce and wrs. its just there's so many rb ""sleepers"" that its impossible to have a good sense for adp. like yahoo has darwin thompson in the 14th round - i'd feel alot better about zero rb if i could consistently get him there..."
subject100,0," - i feel your pain. part of my problem is that there's some rbs that i just don't want a part of (bell, connor) for either rooting reasons, or because i've been burned in the past. carson/michel in 3/4 is awesome though."
subject100,0, - very helpful! thank you!
subject100,0, - true. and presumably the guys who went rb heavy need to spend their late-round picks on wrs. so i will hopefully have a little less competition for those late-round rb fliers.
subject100,0," - thanks. this is really helpful. i feel like this is how my draft most likely plays out. reality is that if 2 of your top 3 picks don't pan out, regardless of strategy, you're gonna have a bad time. i think it would be fun to basically feel ""set"" at wr. one drawback to this strategy - did you ever run across what felt like incredibly juicy wr options at the adp (e.g., kirk or samuels in the 9th) that you'd normally jump all over, but then didn't because you needed to focus on rb? that's one of my concerns - feeling like i can't take value in rounds 6-10 because i need to focus on positional needs/rb."
subject100,0, - that is a nice starting 5!
subject100,0," - yeah. i feel like those guys, since their names are on espn headlines and in sportscenter, get special attention. but you're right about the rest."
subject100,0," - there is a flex, thankfully. of course the downside of the flex is that other folks in the league may be okay loading up on rbs ."

subject100,0," - not what you asked, but i'm always pleasantly surprised by what the city's trash trucks will take. i doubt they'd take the whole shed in one go-round, but if you put out a little bit each week (in bags or barrels), i bet they'd take most everything. i did something similar when i was doing some work in the basement. otherwise, i'd recommend a bagster from home depot. flat rate pricing, and assuming your stuff can fit into 1-2 bags easily, its not too expensive."
subject100,0," - this is the worst narrative. everyone knew there was no chance boston was paying a healthy it. someone would have offered him a max or close to it, and boston didn't have the room, and he didn't fit with their team trajectory. and do we really expect teams in a cap league to throw pity contracts out to injured guys? sure, overpay kobe for a farewell tour after what 18 seasons and 5 rings. same for whatever dirk got in his last year. but to expect the same for a guy who spent 2.5 years in the city on a team with the assets and the cap space to make a finals run? c'mon."
subject100,0, - nta. i can't imagine anyone would think you're a jerk for having to do all the work.
subject100,0," - in lower levels of hockey, sometimes it helps to think of playing defense not as ""i need to win,"" but instead think of ""i need to not lose."" because if you are near/around an offensive player, and you have a chance to put your stick/body in shooting lanes, or if you're in a position to lift a stick or otherwise impede a shot, the opponent's scoring chances go way down. so playing good d is more about being in the right position and knowing what you ""should"" do in any particular scenario than it is about any particular technique (though technique does help as you improve skating etc). so in front of the net, be thinking about how you can maintain your position while being able to react to possible scoring chances: a bouncing puck or rebound gets to their center - are you in a position to tie up that player, or prevent a clean one-timer? the offense cycles the puck to the sides - are you in a position to intercept or deflect any cross-ice or centering passes? if you're on the boards, you want to think about ""how do i slow down the opponent attack""? you don't need to cleanly win the puck and start the breakout. but you need to make sure that the attacking player doesn't cleanly get the puck and leave you behind (thus creating a 3-2 or 2-1 coming off the boards). so think about how you can use your body and stick to slow or delay the attacker until your help defender (ideally one of the wingers) comes over to help clean up. backchecking, again - if its a 2 on 1 or 3 on 1, your job is not to step up and win the puck cleanly. its again to slow down or stop the attackers. make sure its hard for them to ""win."" that means focusing on keeping your body in a position where you can react to whatever the puck-handler wants to do. if they want to shoot - are you screening your goalie, or in a position to block the shot? if they want to pass, is your stick on the ice and blocking passing lanes? if they want to skate wide or try to stickhandle past you, can you stay between the skaters and the net in a position that reduces scoring chances?"

subject100,0," - the bentley track is a great option if you're nearby. and it has parking if you're not. its really hardly ever in use, and while its not shoveled/plowed in the snow, it gets good sunlight and enough foot-traffic that its usually in better shape than the sidewalks."
subject100,0," - +1 for this. you have to stay aware of your surroundings, but nearly every driver is used to seeing runners/walkers sharing the road when the sidewalks are impassable. just dress in clothes that are visible and don't be a jerk, and you'll be fine."

subject100,0," - i did the same thing, and i was fine with the results. i'm not sure what makes one pile of wood better than another, but the price they offered was close to other sites i saw, and the wood burned fine enough for me."
subject100,0," - in fairness, usually the ""mission trip"" comes with a nice check from the missionaries to the locals. its not just ""let us come play construction worker."" its ""let us play construction, and here's $5k."" would it be better if they just sent the money? sure. but for a lot of mission groups, being on-site builds a relationship to an area, and they might return year after year to the same site or general region."
subject100,0," - i don't have specifics, but i find hockey positioning is easier to teach than most other team ball sports, like soccer or basketball. i got with something like this, if you're only doing off-ice stuff: 1. think of the ice as having 3 zones: defending zone (your blue line); interim zone (blue line to blue line); attacking zone (their blue line). each player has a specific job and a general area of responsibility in each zone. so don't ignore the puck/the play, but keep in mind your ""area"" depending on where you are on the ice. 2. you are either a forward or a defenseman. this tells you a lot about where to be in relation to the puck. 3. you are either left or right wing/defense, or center. this tells you a lot about where to be in relation to the rest of your team. 4. know what position everyone else on your team is playing. 5. if you see your teammate out of position because play dictates it (e.g., a forward back-checking during a line change, or a defender leading a rush up ice), think about filling in their position. i think its hard to go into much more than that for beginners, for a few reasons. -hockey is very fluid - you can say generally the defensemen should be on the blue line, but there's plenty of times when they find themselves down low. -beginners won't be able to gauge when they're ""out of position."" for instance, a winger might not feel that they're too low on defense, because they don't know how quickly the puck can make it out to the opponent's point, or how quickly they can close on a shot. if you can do on-ice stuff, i like a lot of simple passing drills. i find those help re-inforce good positional play. things like passing d to wing to center on a break-out. or lw to c to rw moving into the zone. or lw dumps, rw chases, passes to c. lastly, don't underestimate media consumption. when i was a kid, playing games like nhl94 were really helpful in understanding how a team moved as a whole. i don't know what ps/xbox games are out now, but if they're gamers, that might help. same with watching nhl/ncaa games. having someone watch a game, but just watching what a particular player does the whole time. so don't watch the puck, just watch the rds the whole period. see how they move in relation to the puck."

subject100,0," - depends on the location, tbh. where i'm from, lap dances generally mean no touching, but that's definitely not everywhere."
subject100,0," - don't feel bad. i'm the same way. i'm not getting on the ice/getting shifts if i'm not hustling, because i don't have the shot or stickhandling that others do. doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong."
subject100,0," - ""from my perspective, a player without without a stick is of no use at all"" i disagree. try getting a good shot or clean pass off with someone right in your jersey between you and the net. even if they don't have a stick, its not easy."
subject100,0," - for better or worse, most of the main hockey brands are all pretty good for the intro level gear. if its possible, going to a hockey store and trying stuff on is going to be much better than any internet recommendations. a friend of mine who recently got into hockey in his 30s went to one of the bauer/pure hockey stores, and walked out with the ""basic"" level of equipment for all the pieces that fit him well. he definitely paid more than if he shopped for each individual piece from websites, but it took him a fraction of the time, and it was done in one day. if there are any retail resources like that in your area, i'd recommend that as a first step."
subject100,0," - lots of exercises at the gym can help build skating muscle strength. think squats and deadlifts, and lifts that are complementary to those 2. stick-handling at home - anything helps, really. some people build out an awesome ice-simulation, where you have a flat pad that feels like ice, with a training puck, etc. but even if you're just stickhandling a tennis ball or lacrosse ball around obstacles in your living room while you watch tv is going to be better than nothing."
subject100,0," - no one has mentioned it, but take him to see hockey! it doesn't need to be nhl games. high school or any local college games are going to be really fun for a new player interested in the sport. and it something you two can be together bonding about."
subject100,0,"beginner questions - apologies if i'm missing a wiki or instructions page, but i'm curious what people think: 1. do you fill every available spot with towers, and generally slowly level all the towers? or do you only place a few towers on multiplier squares and/or strategic spots, and get those few towers to a very high level? that leads to: 2. do you often buy and place modifiers? i made it to the last level without ever placing a modifier. now if i'm farming a custom map or going for a trophy, i'll place some bounty modifiers. but they seem very situational, and when you factor in research costs, i dunno. 3. do people buy and use spells? they never seem worth it, but i'm also still pretty consistently running out of green research dust. 4. i've seen some people mention completing the research tree. how long does that take? i'd say any random tower level research level for my tree is l5, and i've pretty-well neglected the top branch of the tree. i saw some posts about the about farming, so i think i need to spend some time figuring out how to more efficiently farm."
subject100,0," - thanks. that's a good point about xp generation. a few of my towers have very low passive xp generation, so getting them down a dozen waves early or so will help."
subject100,0," - when you're doing these farming runs, are you going for resource farming with miners or spending that money on towers so you can reach more waves, or some middle ground? sometimes i feel like getting miners up early means my towers are too weak, and a few mobs sneak through."
subject100,0," - thanks. i'd love to level up bounty further, but my next research requires an orange plan. those have been really hard to come by, and i feel like they'd be better used making one of my towers 3-star (or whatever the right term is)."
subject100,0," - the answer might be ""depends,"" but how do you weigh researching yellow/blue techs with resources you have now, vs. saving up for a white tech? for instance, i don't have any cyan blueprints to 3-star my telsa. i could craft 20 xp plans into 1 blue blueprint 5 times; then use those blues for purple blueprint crafting, etc. until i've made a cyan blueprint. but that would take a lot of time, and i'd be foregoing 100+ low priority techs."
subject100,0," - can someone explain what slow freezing does? i'm not clear on how freezing percentage helps matters, whereas its clear to me that the reduced ""freezing speed"" isn't ideal."
subject100,0," - awesome work, thanks! i had always assumed just get each bounty up asap, but its good to see that the math says otherwise."
subject100,0," - take all of this with a grain of salt, since i'm pretty new myself. 1. i'm in the same boat, but different resources. i have a ton of green and purple resources for my custom map, but not much pink. my only solution has been to alternate farming. 1 run on my custom map, and 1 run on a level 3 or 4 map with lots of pink (and on that map i only spend mining resources on pink nodes). 2. still testing things out, but i'm finding that my fastest progression is if i farm mid-level maps on ""endless/hard"" mode. i don't make it as far, but i get a lot of low-level blueprints, and 2-3 blue and purple blueprints. then i combine those blueprints in the crafting feature. its a pain to get an orange blueprint out of this, but its doable. i'm holding off on even worrying about cyan blueprints until i can use all my orange ones. 3. i think yes re: orange chests. 4. again yes, i spend them on cyan chests. 5. yes! its a great little gold boost, especially at a time when waves are getting harder. my current strategy, since i usually go to wave 150ish in my custom map, is to put down 3ish of each miner color. then by wave 70-80 the node is depleted. i sell those, and that reduces the price of the next 3 i put down. so i save money on the front end (in miner price) and the back end (by getting a percent back). 6. no good answer here, but you can tweak individual tower's firing preference. i find that if i set venom/minigun to ""strongest,"" they're better at focusing on the enemies that they're best at, especially in the back-end of the path, when every enemy has taken at least a little damage."
subject100,0,"feature idea - research - not sure how feasible it would be, or what it would do to the interface. but it would be really helpful to have a filter in the research tree. so instead of seeing 150+ possible techs, i could filter the tech tree to ""what can i research with using a purple blueprint, or with using just scalar/matrix?"""
subject100,0," - ok, that makes sense. so having freezing speed at the portal means more enemies are immediately slowed when they spawn (albeit with a faster ""frozen"" speed)."
subject100,0," - i get what you're saying, but i'm not sure i agree. first, i'm sure there's an objective meta. but like most games, not 100% of the player base is plugged into min-maxing, the meta, etc. for instance, i've spent a week or so on the forums, and i have a general idea of the meta, but its not like its all contained in easily-accessed threads. second, even assuming i follow the meta perfectly, there is still a lot of room for non-linear research. using my progress as an example, i have a 3-star tesla, and a 2-star cannon, freeze, and blast. the meta says my next 3 researches are 3-star for each of those towers. to do that, i need 3 cyan blueprints. that will involve weeks of farming basic and blue blueprints, and crafting them up to purple, then orange, then cyan. in the meantime, i will be accumulating a lot of resources and gp. i can be using those non-blueprint resources to unlock miner techs, spell improvements, and other low-level tower research options. not gamechangers by any means, but definitely better to use my resources on those techs than just having them sit in my bank. i can still find those techs, but it involves me manually clicking on 30+ purple-box techs. not ideal. third, even with a well-defined meta, it isn't clear to me within a certain research tree which techs are best. for instance, should i take blast damage to l5, or blast range to l3? both are considered ""top priority"" techs. so being able to filter by cost could make that decision easier. my idea might be a perfectly bad one because its not worth the developer time."
subject100,0,"farming map advice - generally curious about how people go about building their farm maps. i had initially built a very easy portal (80%) with every resource platform i could find. but it seems like that's not encouraged? or at least not encouraged by end-gamers (which i am not). 1. portals - higher portal difficulty means more gp, right? but for those of us without max research, or without tons of great platforms, how do you balance the tradeoff of a challenging portal (or multiple medium difficulty portals) with getting longer waves? is it just test-and-see? similarly, are there enemy-type portals that i should focus on? i love avoiding any of the armored units... 2. base - it seems like there's a lot of garbage bases. like ""disable research effects"" with no seeming benefit. am i missing something here? 3. platform bonuses - with crafting, do you aim for a few great platforms (like 170% damage), or are you comfortable with basically every platform being a moderate benefit. i'd love to craft up more platforms, but crafting platforms is absurdly expensive (15k gp for a legendary damage platform). 4. layout - any agreed-upon ""best layout""? i'd think lots of figure 8s and bottlenecks to take advantage of how blast, cannon and splash work?"
subject100,0, - thanks for the helpful info. much appreciated! i'll look for the map you mention in #4.

subject100,0," - sweet, thanks. the +1 bounty makes it worthwhile."
subject100,0," - just tried it twice, and i think i need some more research progress before i can get there. once i hit 600k or 700k, things really slow down. i might get there eventually on my custom map, but not really willing to run the game for an hour+ to get there."
subject100,0," - piggybacking on op, since i was just about to make this post. do you guys find it ""worth it"" to do the quests? i've done about 10-15 quests on each level just in the course of progressing through the storyline and farming early techs. the trophy is a huge draw, but i feel like a month+ of game time would be better spent farming for key techs. on the other hand, sometimes quest rewards are really nice (e.g., an orange blueprint for clearing a level 1.1 quest). thoughts?"

subject100,0, - awesome post! thanks for doing the math!
subject100,0,"no goalies - scoring preference - most times at stick-and-puck, we have no goalies. growing up, we always put the nets down on the ground, and scoring meant hitting the half-moons that the top of the nets made. current location always plays that posts/crossbar/center post is a goal, though. i'm curious what people prefer to play when there's no goalies."
subject100,0,"spell improvements too costly - does anyone else think that researching techs to give more spells are secretly terrible? i'm talking about how when you first research a spell, and buy one of those spells, it might cost 10 greens and 10 gp. but if you research lv 5 of that spell tech, and own 6 of those spells, and want to buy 1 more, it now costs 50 yellow and 500 gp. so now spending 1 spell costs significantly more. first, i'm rarely using 7 nukes in a battle. maybe i'm in the minority here, but unless i'm going for a trophy, its rare that i'm spending the majority, let alone all, of the spells i have. second, the ""solution"" of only buy 1 spell when you need it is gimmicky and not fun. i can see the developers wanting there to be a ""cost"" associated with keeping a full load of spells in case you want them, but i don't think its well-balanced. i think it would make more sense to make the spells cost the same across the board, and then have the cost increase as you research more techs associated with that spell (so that the spells aren't too costly for beginners)."
subject100,0," - good point. i'm pretty early on in playing/research, so i feel like i should be saving tickets. but its good to know that ultimately tickets solve this problem. thanks!"
subject100,0," - not only that, but its a numbers game most of the time on offense/defense in beer league. so option 1 - make them take it - you don't have the puck, but you are at least next to 1-2 of the opponents. or option 2 - give it away - now you don't have the puck, and you're probably behind the play."
subject100,0," - if there are guys on the bench, and you're gliding through the neutral zone because you're tired, change lines. don't be a dick taking 5-minute shifts if you're only actually skating for about 45 seconds of that shift."
subject100,0," - true, and a great point. there's a guy that comes to pick-up that is really skilled. like, can accelerate fast, great hands, and can put it top shelf in a blink. but he coasts for 2 minutes, skates hard for 45 seconds when he has a chance to make a rush, and then coasts for another 2 minutes. in that 45 second burst, he might score, or at least have a really good chance to score. so he thinks his shift was a ""win."" but everyone else out there watching on the bench is thinking that this guy is dead weight/sucks to play with."
subject100,0," - i personally would love to back in a world of 15 skaters, 45-second line changes, etc. but i don't think that's a reality in many leagues."
subject100,0," - are you discouraging goalies from showing up!!?? bite your tongue, sir! /s mostly, but in all seriousness, i'd rather play against patrick roy than have the other team playing with an empty net, or playing posts."
subject100,0, - that's a damn good ref!
subject100,0," - its all about how he plays, honestly. if he takes the approach of ""my team is never losing,"" and acts accordingly (end-to-end rushes, hard slapshots that the goalies have no shot at), then he's a jerk. if you decide to play down because you want hockey to fit your schedule and you love skating, it can't be about winning or losing. if he racks up those 2-3 ppg because he set up his teammates with a nice pass, or was in a good position to stuff home a rebound or one-timer, or because he intercepted a sloppy pass, then fine. but also be fine losing when your team is legitimately outmatched."
subject100,0," - i go for the latter: look up random exercises depending on what i need. for instance, i've been incorporating more deadlifts into my running days, and my hamstrings are destroyed the whole day after deadlifts. a few sites suggest more downward dog and cat/cow poses to warm up the next day, so the hamstrings aren't too tight when i skate/run. same for hip flexibility. growing up, i could easily throw my leg onto the boards, and twist every which-way to get loose before a game. that's a lot harder now, and when i try i really feel it in the tendons that run down the outside of your hips (it band, maybe)? so i've picked up a few exercises with resistance bands that i try to work in when i'm standing around at work. i'm sure there's a general program for all of this stuff, and certainly there are classes aimed at this (look for stuff like yoga for athletes in your area). but i always find that the ""best"" program for me is what i can remember to do, and i find that to be these one-off targeted stretches to hit the stuff that i'm feeling the day after exercise."
subject100,0," - its all about reading the room. if someone wants the advice, or if the team generally is looking for strategy, then go for it. especially if you practice what you preach. seems like your team likes it, so more power to you. and thanks for sharing your expertise with newer players."
subject100,0," - splash is great, but i feel like it mostly shines in custom farming maps, and a few specific in-game maps (like 5.5). there are a lot of maps where tile placement and enemy composition doesn't let splash really excel. plus it also takes a lot of research for it to get good."
subject100,0,"best/worst spells - i may be missing something, but it seems like a few spells are real clunkers. bullet wall seems to do laughable damage, even though it has a rather high mdps rating. thunder's randomness really kills it for me, unless its a map like 5.5 where you can be reasonably certain of having lots of enemies clustered in one area. windstorm is interesting, but i feel like blizzard is better in nearly all instances. ball lightning just doesn't seem to have enough dps. i'm always very happy with smoke bomb (which really needs a new name because it looks/acts a lot more like poison than smoke), and nuke/loic/magnet are all great. so i'm really only quibbling with that 6th spell slot. thoughts?"
subject100,0," - thanks, that's really helpful, because i am hard-capped by constructor in nearly every formulation of my custom maps."
subject100,0," - good point about nerfs. i have to keep reminding myself that the meta can change at any time, and so i should generally not ""ignore"" any spells or towers too badly in research."
subject100,0," - agreed 100%. but if you're new to the game and you hear nonstop ""research splash,"" i think you're going to have a really hard time finishing the story mode. i might be wrong, because i had the misfortune of doing 80% of story mode before 1.6 (or whatever the major research changing patch was), but i found that story mode progress was a lot easier by spreading research around a few key towers (mainly due to research costs at the time)."
subject100,0," - i'm in the same boat age-wise and job-wise, though complicated a bit by toddlers that still don't 100% sleep through the night. but the work day after game nights, i'm generally going to be hurting/tired. i take a few steps to help with wakeup the next morning. i'll have a big glass of water next to bed, and drink it right when i wake up. this helps wake me up, but it also helps hydrate me right away. i try not to drink too much post-game (beer or water), because i find that keeps me up, and might make me pee at 3-4 am. i also set a slightly louder phone alarm that i need to stretch slightly to reach on my nightstand. so its much harder for me to sub-consciously hit snooze. and back to the kids, but for better or worse, i haven't gotten 7+ hours of uninterrupted sleep for more than a few days straight for the past 4-5 years, so i'm tired anyways. so i just tell myself, i'm going to tired anyways. might as well have the joy of playing hockey to help offset that :)"
subject100,0," - amen. i get saying ""save them"" makes a lot of sense if you're running a farm map 10+ times per day and average 10kgp per minute. but if you're slowly progressing through the levels, the cyan chests are a massive boost. a new player is going to have a much better experience buying cyan chests and using a nice (if not amazing) boost of goods in the first few weeks of playing, versus sitting on a mountain of accelerators for 3-4 months because they ""might"" become more valuable. and let's also acknowledge that at the point accelerators become more valuable, there will probably be more means of acquiring them."
subject100,0," - this is a big one. up in the northeast, a lot of full and half marathons have some monster hills that require pace adjustment. i think a pacer should assume most runners have done some basic homework about the course, but reminders are always nice."
subject100,0,"what do you sell? - curious what people out there sell, given that the game is subject to further development. custom map tiles, excess mined resources, crappy bases, etc. on one hand, the cash infusion is nice. on the other hand, i could see some of the unused items/resources being put to use in future patches via crafting or otherwise."
subject100,0," - ""you sure you're a ref lol"" can definitely be considered hostile. it's not loud and aggressive, which we usually associate with hostility, but it's calling into question their credentials in a way that is not encouraging constructive discussion. not saying i would consider it hostile, but people have different expectations about message board civility."
subject100,0," - one of my favorites, though not sure if its ""etiquette."" you don't have to practice shooting on the net. sometimes its nicer to grab 5ish pucks, square up 5-10 feet from the boards, and work on your form. then you're not hogging the slot, or slowing down everyone else digging the pucks out of the netting."
subject100,0," - piggy-backing on comments. when you buy a new stick, buy a new on-ice stick. take your current or backup stick and saw off a few inches. that way you get the ""better"" stick for on-ice when it matters."
subject100,0," - that's the rule of thumb. not sure how closely its ever been tested? but if it saves me $150, i'm okay with a slightly stiffer stick, especially if i'm just practicing. i'm also not going pro any time soon, so your preferences might differ from mine."
subject100,0," - it wasn't asked, but lasik! i was contacts for the past 20+ years, and finally got around to lasik 2 years ago. it has been amazing. and the price, while high, isn't outrageous. especially for those of us now used to paying $150 for a hockey stick."
subject100,0," - it depends on everyone's eyes. in my teens and twenties, i was like you. i could wear contacts for 20 hours straight, and pop the same ones back in no problem the next day. as you get older, your eye shape changes and your eye physiology changes, and prolonged contact use can be impossible. i tried a dozen different brands (through an optometrist practice specializing in contact lens fit) in my 30s trying to re-capture that same duration of wearing, and just never found it."
subject100,0, - i actually took the leap and did lasik 2 years ago. i was sick of not being comfortable with contacts. my only regret is waiting so long.
subject100,0," - lots of town recreation departments have random pick-up stick-and-puck. check your town's and surrounding towns' recreation departments websites, or the websites for the hockey rinks. most of the rinks near where i live will at least have 2-3 hours a week of pick-up. you can also try: https://www.stinkysocks.net/ i haven't tried any of their games (i keep meaning to), but a co-worker says they're pretty good, and the website is pretty slick compared to what you usually see from adult leagues and rec departments. he said they're not always the best games, and a bit pricey on a per-game basis compared to joining an adult league. but its an option."
subject100,0," - love it. i actually prefer 3v3 or 4v4. more room to skate, easier to make passes. if i'm being honest with myself, its probably because i'm less skilled, but usually a better skater (or at least better at hustling) than most people at my skill level."
subject100,0," - mine all in was a little less than $5k in the us, but there are places that can do it cheaper. i shopped around and was quoted as low as $2.7k. but i had really bad vision. my contact prescription was -5.5. so i wanted to make sure i was getting good care. i don't know if i can say that i'm going to ""save"" $5k on eye expenses (new glasses, new contacts, optometrist appointments) over the next 15-20 years, but it has absolutely been worth it. being able to see the alarm clock when i wake up, being able to see in the shower or while swimming, not worrying about having my lenses in too long, or packing enough saline. again, its a steep price tag, but i was more than happy to spend a few years driving a crummy car and packing lunches to work to save up for it."
subject100,0," - i think that's generally good advice to ""play like the pros,"" but for lower level leagues, know your surroundings. what i mean is that there are lots of aspects of high-level hockey positioning that don't translate very well when you have slower, out of position players all over the ice (and i don't mean this as a dig - i am one of those slower, out of position guys). there are a lot of low level d-men that can't shoot worth a damn (or really even manage to hold the puck at the point). so its not great to spend your defensive effort sitting on their hip. there are a lot of low level goalies that can handle any point shot. if that's your goalie, maybe worry less about blocking the shot, and instead worry more about moving screeners or cleaning up rebounds. further, wingers covering d-men is based on the assumption that your d-men or center are covering the front of the net and the slot. but we all know that's not always the case. if you have a center that dangles at the blue line, or a d-man who always finds himself behind the net, you maybe need to play at the hashes or lower. i think the ""right"" way to play is the one that meshes with what your teammates are expecting. if they need you down lower to poke-check anyone in the slot, or make easier break-out passes, then do just that. it doesn't help anyone if your team can't break out, but its not your fault, because ""you were in the right spot."" but, keep in mind that positioning is applicable for everyone. so if your teammates expect you to be in position x to perform task y, then they also need to be where they say they will be, and do what they say they will do."
subject100,0," - be up front about your expectations for the team. everyone wants to win, but are you looking to move up divisions? are you expecting everyone to ""play their position"" and run your preferred breakout plays? do you expect a social aspect for the team?"
subject100,0," - they're playing in a rink in canada, soooo?"
subject100,0," - not a goalie, but have subbed a few times. since i'm not good with my blocker, pads, etc., i would rather face a shot glove-side. so i cheat a little to my right (blocker side) when i'm in the crease. it makes the glove side more inviting for a shooter, and i can focus ""more"" on shots going to one place. i am a little taller than most, though, so reach isn't a problem if i'm cheating like this."
subject100,0, - put a cop there to ticket everyone pulling that crap and we wouldn't need property taxes.
subject100,0, - especially if you want something quick. wilson's you could be in and out in 10 minutes if you asked.
subject100,0," - this is the best advice. chances are, if you don't know where to be, a lot of other people on your team or in your league don't know either. so generally try to be in open space. if your ""spot"" dictates you to be along the boards, but your teammate is already there, it doesn't help if you go skate next to him or her. also, if you're on a team that consistently has you playing with the same players, learn their tendencies. my defensemen loooove to rush the puck, and so they get trapped down low in the attacking zone a lot. so if i'm playing wing, i need to keep that in mind, and maybe cover for them. stuff like that."
subject100,0," - great advice. at my local stick-and-puck drop-in, a team of guys similar to op all show up together. they all did learn-to-skate and now play for a beginner league, but still get beat up pretty much every league game. if you're going to be 8 or 9 of the 15 or so people playing pick-up, its much easier to dictate the skill level. so they basically get to scrimmage themselves and get used to playing as teammates."
subject100,0," - http://pointstreaksites.com/view/neshl this is a site that covers a bunch of different leagues in and around metro boston. wide variety of leagues, from a to d. you've likely missed out on the winter/spring 2020 season, but i'd reach out to the league now to see what teams might be looking for skaters, or how to find a team for fall 2020. https://www.stinkysocks.net/ this site has a lot of pick-up games in and around boston. lastly, i'd say check the local rinks in your town and the surrounding towns. i like 5 miles west of boston, and every rink in the towns i border (except for college rinks) has some form of adult pick-up hockey at least once a week."
subject100,0," - both sites i linked are non-contact. skill level is hard to gauge. probably b, maybe a? you might not have the ""skill"" that some a level players have. many a level players played d1 hockey or the canadian youth equivalent (or even better), but you'd likely make up any skill deficit by being 18 and having fresh legs. don't discount jv/club in college, too. it might feel like more of a time commitment, but the downside of a lot of ""adult"" leagues is that you're not necessarily getting practice time, or consistent game time, or consistent game locations. it can mean a lot of driving around metro boston at 9pm on a random tuesday. that doesn't always mesh well with being a freshman in college, and studying for exams or doing problem sets."
subject100,0," - so long as you're in the right league. some guys in lower leagues (beginner/d/c) will get pissed at a goalie letting in ""soft"" goals, but those guys are jerks. if a team is giving you a hard time, just find a new team. supply and demand - everyone needs goalies."

subject100,0," - take it with a grain of salt, as i've been a homeowner for the last 5 years. but in renting 5 different apartments in and around boston since the mid-2000s, i've never had the broker fee be worth it. especially when you consider that most rentals are going to be at or north of $2k/month. a $2k broker fee is a lot of money. even if you believe an agent is worth $100/hour for their work (which is an incredibly generous overestimate), are you getting 20 hours of work from a broker when you rent a place? usually not. the only way i could see it being worthwhile is if you have really specific needs that you don't see getting met on craigslist posts, or if you're doing the apartment search remotely and can't visit potential rentals. otherwise, i found that craigslist/padmapper/etc. had postings that were just as good (sometimes with more detail and/or better pictures), with landlords that were just as easy to deal with. but at the end of the day, the landlords dictate whether a spot is no-fee or not."
subject100,0," - amen. its unfortunate, because rowing is such a great workout, but it is by far the easiest ""general cardio"" exercise that can really hurt you. cycling, running, etc. of course you can get injuries, but usually its pretty clear that something isn't right with form/technique/etc. for beginners. rowing, you need to be a bit more careful."

subject100,0," - just a note, the website charges a ridiculous convenience/processing fee on payments that is a percentage of the bill. i think its 3%. the only reason i have checks and stamps at home is to pay these bills. not sure who in city government is responsible for this oversight/poor vendor selection, but its a real barrier to waltham's government website becoming something good and useful like other cities (somerville, to name one)."
subject100,0, - probably because it needs to be dark enough to see how they go? and 9pm is when its pretty dark?
subject100,0," - unrelated to op, but can you only run 1 factory at a time? i have 3 factories (2 micro, 1 large), but if 1 is running, i can't get the other 2 to produce anything."
subject100,0," - no, he's saying the majority. for every carcassone app (100k+ downloads on google play for $5 per), there are dozens of free-to-play or paid apps with less than 10k downloads. and those app store prices are not the developer's net revenue. app stores may take up to 30%. now the median costs of developing and maintaining an app is unknowable. too many variables. but its not hard to envision apps that cost $50-$100k in developer time struggle to break even. i doubt they show overall losses, because most of these companies are small, with the developers paying themselves in part in equity."
subject100,0," - that's not really true. digital products have substantial ongoing costs that physical products don't. updating the product when a new os comes out; maintaining servers if the game has an online component; fixing any bugs that appear; adapting to changes in phone/platform hardware. you can say these aren't ""production costs"" from a technical accounting standpoint, but that's missing the main point. some people think of digital products as having ""no cost"" compared to physical products, but that's simply not true."
subject100,0," - agreed. i think people often get too bogged down into what something ""should"" cost, as if that's how businesses come up with their msrp/download price/etc. i think there's a perfectly good debate to be had on the merits and downsides of a physical boardgame, vs. a digital one. and some of this thread has touched on it. but one of those debate points can't/shouldn't be ""a $10 app means the developers profit too much,"" because we have basically none of the information necessary to evaluate that claim."
subject100,0," - i mean, stuff can go wrong (and right) on both sides of digital vs. physical board games. physical board games: lose pieces, break a board, lose the game, calamity (house fire, flooding, hurricane, tornado that wipes out most/all possessions). digital games: developer goes bankrupt, software/hardware updates, change in licensing. like i said below, there's lots of good reasons for preferring physical games, or feeling like some digital board games are priced too high. but one of the reasons shouldn't be ""digital products should cost less because there's no physical components to produce"" (which was the original discussion point of this sub-thread)."
subject100,0," - not back yet, but i'm interested in this thread. personally, if/when leagues come back (i'm in ma, so expecting leagues in the fall), i feel like i'll be waiting, and maybe sitting out the first half of the season (or even waiting until fall 2021). i absolutely love playing, but between work and family, i'd feel like a pretty big dummy if after all this social distancing/quarantine, i spread covid because of d league hockey."
subject100,0," - first, my experience has been that the permitting/inspection department was fine. it wasn't exactly ""fast,"" but it was what i expected for the low-tech world of home improvement. my understanding more generally from friends/neighbors is that there are some contractors that are not well-received by the building permit office. so the projects that those contractors bring often get delayed/rejected/have requests for modifications or more information/etc. if you don't have one of those contractors, the permitting process is fine (or as good as any other city in ma, which is to say, still has its fair share of red-tape). but if you're not messing too much with the house's ""footprint,"" it shouldn't be too bad."
subject100,0," - i think maybe horn pond in winchester/woburn? but i wouldn't recommend it, as its not terribly clean. not in a trash sense, but in a muck/wildlife sense. mystic lake in arlington/winchester maybe? - you can't bring a dog to the beach, but you might be able to find some access points (or make friends with someone that has a house abutting the lake?"
subject100,0," - how far are you looking to go? there's not a ton within 30min or so of waltham. walden pond is probably your best bet. mystic lakes doesn't really have hiking, but it does have walking trails (and is in a quiet suburban neighborhood - so good for kids on bikes, or walking a dog - https://www.mass.gov/locations/mystic-lakes-state-park). if you're willing to make a day trip, then your options get almost overwhelming. cape cod, new hampshire/maine/vermont, central ma all have lots of rural areas and ocean or lake beaches."
subject100,0, - i've never been in a league that bans pick trading. it just doesn't happen ever.
subject100,0, - where's that 80% from?
subject100,0," - best comment. first part of working out as a sweaty dude/gal is accepting your sweatiness, and learning to love it."
subject100,0," - but you're probably not playing it with ""every precaution available."" you might be playing with what hockey players consider ""standard,"" but don't pretend like a. its reducing all risk, or b. there isn't more you could be doing. do you have something guarding your calves beyond what standard pads offer? because getting a skate to the calf/achilles can cause serious damage. but that sort of protection isn't common, and it makes skating tough. do you have a dentist fitting your mouthguard, and do you keep that mouthguard at all times, even on the bench? do you replace your helmet at least 10 years prior to manufacture date (or earlier if something happens to it)? playing hockey at any sort of competitive level, even beer league, is going to involve risk of bodily injury. strapping a neck guard on might reduce (but not entirely eliminate) a very serious but very infrequent injury. but not strapping one on isn't ""reckless"" by any means."
subject100,0," - since no one is answering your question - yes, you can sew it smaller. the point of the neckguard is to prevent a hockey blade from cutting your neck. so long as your neckguard is creating a barrier via skin contact on the front and sides of your neck, you'll be fine."
subject100,0," - are you going to a third party for insurance? or is the rink just sticking an extra $200 on top of the rental fee, and allocating part of it as ""insurance""? to your question, i've never had to get stand-alone insurance when renting a rink. instead, the rink just charges extra if you're not renting via an organization with insurance (like an adult league)."
subject100,0," - a few folks i play pickup with went to the hockey academy, which has an adult section. can't comment on how good it is, but they had good things to say about it (and still wear the jerseys issued by the hockey academy). http://www.adulthockey.com/ i have no idea whether they're operating with covid, but i'd keep them on my radar."
subject100,0," - do you ""know"" hockey? like watch nhl or other teams regularly? do you play street hockey with friends? if no, one of the best things you can do is to start watching games, or get an nhl-style video game, so you can start understanding things like the flow of the game, positions, basic rules, etc. in terms of learning to play, i think the last thing newer ""older"" players should worry about or focus on is your shot. unless you're playing in a beginner league, its going to be a long time before you're consistently beating an experienced goalie. instead focus on passing, skating, etc."
subject100,0," - ""baseball clubhouses, moreover, are not that different from school classrooms."" citation needed on that one. i'm going to need more than an unsubstantiated slate blogger's opinion. i'm not saying that schools should be opened because pro sports are opened. but the converse is also true. just because baseball social distancing isn't working (which is a broad statement to make based on one team's outbreak, but regardless...) doesn't mean that social distancing doesn't work in all instances."
subject100,0," - what's the difference between schools and professional sports locker rooms? besides being indoors? potentially a lot, but i don't know, and this author certainly doesn't know. my only point is that trying to apply the results of one baseball team's experiences to all schools isn't anything. its just some blogger's random assumptions, and therefore not valuable. there's also zero analysis about team clubhouse protocols (and whether they were actually followed), and there's no discussion about any other teams/sports (e.g., the nhl has administered 7k tests so far with no positive hits; the entire taiwanese baseball league, which has been playing for weeks, has no positive cases). its just a dumb leap from ""x doesn't work, so y can't work."" there's plenty of better discussions about covid and schools, including already on the r/waltham page. many of which promote the same conclusions that full-time, in-person school might increase covid cases. this is a just crap ""article"" from slate, though, and isn't useful for analyzing how to approach this disease. its frankly more of the sort of ""analysis"" that got us here in the first place."
subject100,0," - honestly, this attitude makes no sense. first, you might have covid but be asymptomatic. so if you wear a mask, even if no one else does, you're protecting your teammates and your leaguemates. why wouldn't you want to do that? second, a lot of people are followers. if they see 2-3 people wearing masks, they might be more inclined to wear one. ""no one else is wearing one"" never changes unless someone decides to be the first one to put on a mask. you're not going to have everyone magically coordinating their behavior (unless there's a requirement by the rink/government). i'm sure plenty of locations can justify no masks, based on population density, geographic isolation, overall virus incidence, etc. but i'm in a part of the us where the numbers are still not great, so i'm absolutely wearing a mask."
subject100,0," - no, i understood you. you said ""its almost pointless to wear a mask if no one else is wearing one."" and i don't think that's true."
subject100,0," - what do you mean inline skating never took? i realize its not a perfect skill transfer, but getting very comfortable on inlines will make a huge difference as a beginner. the problem with adult hockey is that ice time is very scarce and very expensive. but improvement really only comes by practicing. i'd suggest giving inlines another chance. sorry for the offtopic response, but having friends who were on a similar path to you, unless you're in a ""learn to skate/play"" league, its really hard to improve enough to even hang in a beginner's league. because if you take the ice now, you're going to basically going to be practicing skating while 9 other players have a game around you."
subject100,0," - one-footed skating, especially on the non-dominant foot, can be really helpful. imagine taking a tight turn, but picking up your outside foot. obviously you won't be going as fast, or turning as tight. but you'll be forcing the on-ice foot/leg to improve the ""balancing"" muscles. off-ice, doing a lot of balancing/strengthening moves targeting the non-dominant leg. one-legged balance ball work; resistance band training; one-legged squats. again, you're focusing less on the ""big"" muscles like your calf and your quad in the non-dominant leg, but rather you're getting the ancillary muscles stronger, and getting your balance better."
subject100,0," - very understandable re: inlines, especially falling. falling hurts way more on inlines due to friction, and most people usually use inlines with a lot less padding. so its doubly painful. for what its worth, if you can stick it out with inlines, its a huge advantage. now instead of finding ice time, and paying $10+ per hour to practice skating, all you need is an empty parking lot, tennis court, etc to get some practice in. plus, if covid keeps rinks closed or leagues down, you can head into 2021 with a much stronger base. not sure your location, but there are a lot of programs like this one (http://www.adulthockey.com/) where beginners have a combination of skills clinics and scrimmages that lead into playing in leagues. the programs like this near me (in ma) do a good job of balancing skill levels, too, so its less likely that your fellow players skate circles around you."
subject100,0," - check the menus online before you go, but gustazo and tempo are definitely considered ""good food."" every place is going to have the same vibe at this point, since everyone is outside in the same environment."
subject100,0,"best tablet for civ vi? tips/expectations? - i'm not terribly tablet-savvy, so i'm curious what folks would recommend for a good civ vi experience. i generally enjoy playing large games on the longer paces (civ v my go-to setting was marathon/huge). i'm also curious if folks who used to play on desktops/laptops but have since moved to tablets to primarily play have any thoughts or suggestions or expectations. i logged probably 1k+ hours on civ v/be back in 2013-2015 on my laptop, but haven't touched civ vi yet and am looking to get back into the series. apologies that this post might be repetitive, but a lot of the ""tablet"" search results for this sub showed discussions from 1-2 years ago, and i figured tablet technology has updated a bit."

subject100,0," - rowing is fantastic for burning calories/building muscle tone. its a full-body workout that can have a lot of variety (e.g., long, slow rows of 5k meters; short intervals of 500m). take a look at competitive rowers. they're strong but relatively lean. its hard to compare to running or other cardio to rowing, because each exercise type works different muscle groups and intensity/duration matters. but if rowing ""works"" for you for whatever reason where other cardio didn't, then definitely do it!"
subject100,0," - short answer: it depends. https://www.city.waltham.ma.us/recycling-department/pages/disposal-index-recycling-trash there's not a waltham dump you can just show up with anything at, but waltham does have a relationship with the minuteman hazardous waste facility (see page 2 here: https://www.city.waltham.ma.us/sites/g/files/vyhlif1386/f/uploads/2020_online_brochure.pdf)."
subject100,0, - i only regret that i have but one upvote to give.
subject100,0," - i think he's saying ""what's the downside of each top 20 player?"" like, if he has the first pick: cmc is going to be on a really bad team, or saquon's touches might go down because the giants have more weapons this year."
subject100,0," - not op, but... breakout - this is how your team gets possession of the puck in the defensive zone, and moves the puck into the neutral zone. the general move assumes a defenseman has the puck at or behind the endline. the dman passes to the center, who is somewhere in front of the net in between the two faceoff circles. the center then passes to one of the wingers. attack triangle is a strategy for how the forwards behave in the attacking zone. again, the assumption is 3 forwards pushing the puck into attacking zone, and there are 2 defenders in the way. the general idea is that you want to form a triangle with someone ""up high"" - i.e., around the hash marks to be a threat to shoot, and the other 2 players are ""down low"" closer to the net. they're in a position to (a) draw the defenders away, (b) threaten any potential rebounds, and (c) be an option for a pass. defensive positioning is pretty straightforward, and i suspect you already know it. wingers are near the defenseman at the blue line; defenders are chasing the puck, and the center helps in corners and/or helps in front of the net. the real challenge is (a) practicing moving as a unit as the puck moves, and (b) what to do when someone gets pulled out of position."
subject100,0," - sounds like your coach is bad. are you one of the better players? sometimes a player can get through to his or her teammates better than a coach. yelling at people, pointing out that the team sucks, leading by example, etc. sometimes what seems like being a dick in normal life is what's needed in sports. lebron james yells at his teammates when they miss a play, but he's not a bad guy. ultimately, if your teammates ignore you/don't care about winning/""just want to have fun,"" there's not much you can do, other than find a new team. or just play for your own stats. rush the puck yourself; take lots of shots; don't pass to the baddies; take long shifts and don't backcheck hard. if no one else cares about the ""team,"" there's no point giving yourself an aneurysm caring for them."
subject100,0," - i think either way works, so long as everyone is on the same page. we always passed to the center for 2 reasons: 1. if the puck is on either side of the ice, its likely that there will be 1-2 opponents in between or near your winger. that doesn't give your winger much time/freedom to make a clean pass to your center. 2. if you move the puck to your center, then you open up the ice to pass to both sides, making it twice as likely that your winger will be open. it also means that your centerman can skate the puck out of the zone if the other team has 2+ players below the hashmarks. but you're definitely right that having a puck in the slot is higher-risk/higher-reward."
subject100,0," - honestly that sounds incredibly frustrating for you. i'd start treating games like a practice. do things that you want to work on, and use the games as a chance to improve. ignore the score, and tell yourself that your chance to defend against a 3-1 rush (because your teammates are out of place) is a chance to get better."
subject100,0," - is it possible to farm xp without using stamina (i.e., using levels that you've already opened)? i have a few characters in the 20s-30s that i think would ultimately be better than my 60s, so i'd like to level them up. but i don't want to waste 2-3 weeks worth of stamina on the exp dungeons."
subject100,0," - thanks, that's what i figured/worried about. this seems like a fun game, but levelling up different characters definitely feels like there's a big time-gate unless i spend some serious $$."
subject100,0," - hmm, hadn't heard of these codes. i'm android, but maybe there's something equivalent. thanks!"
subject100,0," - no one has mentioned property taxes, so i'll piggyback off that. some of these towns mentioned are 2x or 3x the tax for an equivalent property in waltham. if you're buying, that can make a big difference in your monthly tax+mortgage+insurance payment."
subject100,0," - like the above poster, the schools are objectively ""good"" when compared to public schools elsewhere across the state, and certainly across the nation. but when you're down the road from towns that are nationally ranked in the ""25 best school districts"" in various lists (cities like dover, lexington, brookline, etc.), then the schools don't look so good. as someone who thinks parental involvement/home environment is just as important as a district's mcas scores, i feel like waltham is a perfectly fine school district."
subject100,0," - great point. i think too often people focus on what stores are in a city, but that's not always so important. its also important to note that a store might be in the same city, but that doesn't mean its necessarily closer. if you live in newtown highlands, getting to trader joe's is going to take a long time, even though both are ""in newtown."" i'd wager most walthamites living east of waltham common could get there faster during rush hour, even though the store is technically 2 towns a way."

subject100,0," - how does franchise these days stack up to some of the early 2000s maddens? i've been away from gaming for awhile pretending to be an adult, and all this home time has me thinking about a ps or xbox. i loved those mid-2000s maddens because your team would progress significantly more if you made a deep playoff run, which meant that you could draft and develop talented backups that eventually became starters."
subject100,0,"28 days in. keep going? - so i just hit 28 days in - a full clear of the daily rewards. some thoughts and questions for the sub. the big question being, is it worth it to keep playing? 1. i've cleared the story line and most of the towers/rifts. it seems like developers are going to be active in adding new chapters and frequent events. that's definitely a plus to keep playing. 2. on the other hand, endgame seems pretty meh so far. guild farming = fighting the same bosses over and over, for what seem like very moderate rewards. colosseum = hard to tell where the ""skill"" comes in to play besides farming up to improve your characters (aside, i'm f2p, so i only have 4-5 60+ characters that are even relevant). arena = my server is pacific time, and i'm on eastern time, so i have 1 1-hour window to play? not great. 3. really good mix of character types (though light on tanks), and weapons, so you can try out lots of different playstyles. 4. its a total pain to level new characters. either you're auto-running rifts for xp, or you're just slowly grinding awakening and evolution stones. not a ton of fun. i have 2 characters that i'd consider ""good"" - 5-star male knight at 65 and 4-star lupina at 63. both are prob 75% awakened. that took a month. it seems like if i want to power someone up, it will cost a bundle. 5. prices generally feel high. i unlocked the fire character this event, and got an invite for a $40 usd bundle to level her up? i'm not much of a mobile gamer, but other games from supercell like brawlstars had a much lower price point for levelling. 6. the game seems somewhat obtuse. like the fact that some units have auras that are never explained in-game. or there's a 2-second tutorial about chaining skills, which is pretty darn important. admittedly i'm bad at discord, but i've seen a lot of similar mobile games with at least a half-decent wiki, and no offense, but this sub seems to be mostly memes/art. 7. the shop needs some rebalancing. like colosseum points. i need to win 300 matches to get a useful item? i get that the weekly gem prize is the real reward, but why have any tokens at all then? 8. some levels in events and in tower/rift just seem to be designed to be an ""f you"" to the players. if you don't have the right character type (like a cannon character - which by the way where do they ever describe what a cannon character is?) or the right weapon type (so you can jump over immovable scarecrows) levelled up, you're just stuck. and then you're stuck deciding - do i care about levelling a new character/weapon just to keep moving along? or do i wait until that levelling happens in due course, or my mains get strong enough to brute-force it? 9. the daily mail rewards and the heavenhold mini-game are a really great idea. nice way to make those frequent checkins worthwhile, and they're a nice change of pace to the game. 10. adding old events as ""side stories"" is a great idea. i wish more games would repurpose old events, if only for the content and the cosmetic rewards. anyways, i'd be curious how others feel about the game. i feel like the nature of being on a sub for a game means people are generally positive towards the game, but i'd love to hear about what keeps people coming back after clearing the majority of the content."
subject100,0, - the tower and heavenhold also give great xp. usually more than the xp dungeon. down side is that they're a limited number.
subject100,0," - if you go to inventory, you can sell them. i think for option stones? you need a critical mass to sell though. i think 40 or 80 depending on the character type. inventory is a button or two away from the shop button on that slide-out menu."
subject100,0," - always do awakening dungeons. i find awakening stones are always in short supply. also, do colosseum. even if you lose, it's free gems every week. after a few weeks, you can pull the gems for a shot at a good hero."
subject100,0," - it's worth a try. you get the stamina back if you fail. and the event rewards to me seem good ""bang for your stamina buck"" if you clear a level. i just started during the last event and could only do 3 of the events, and i was glad i did them."
subject100,0," - awesome, thanks. i always like hearing the perspective of how this game compares to similar games. so i appreciate your comment!"
subject100,0," - that's kind of how i feel. it would be really fun to play this game/endgame with a roster of 7-9 levelled characters, so you can mix and match for unique combos. just too bad it might take 6 months to get there. its also nice to know that devs are still working hard on tweaking the game and listening to the community."
subject100,0," - ha, good point about being hooked :). i haven't gotten into the memes, yet, but maybe if today is a slow day."
subject100,0," - yeah. i just sometimes struggle staying engaged in a game that becomes like farmville - log in for 5 minutes 2-3 times a day. i'm hopeful that the events, and things like the five free summon week, keep me engaged/focused."
subject100,0," - good point about the sword-break story. i'm hoping that comes back soon, since after chapter 1, the whole sword story arc fell off. thanks for at least reading 3 lines ;)"
subject100,0," - awesome, thanks for the link. i'm also trying to spend more time in the megathread. seems like there's some good info there once i can digest what all the acronyms/abbreviations mean."
subject100,0," - what's your gold situation like? i find that i'm often short on gold, between awakenings and levelling up weapons for my mains. if i wasn't selling the random crud weapons (and instead spending more gold to random evolve them), i'd be really cash strapped."
subject100,0," - can't say definitively, but my current set up allows for either two separate chains, or a four-link chain, and for pve i really like it. sometimes you only need two chains to clear the room (especially the rift fights where only chains do damage), but having all 4 makes certain bosses much easier. for pvp, i'm no expert, but i find that one of my characters usually dies within the first 25% of a fight. so having 2 separate chains is nice, because if the dead unit is early in your 4-link chain, you're out of luck."
subject100,0," - i probably did it wrong, because i played for 2+ weeks before ever looking into strategy. but having at least some awakenings on 2+ units really makes story mode and events go easier. i feel like there's a lot of talk about endgame pvp and whats optimal, but it takes awhile to get there if you're f2p, and it will be really tough sledding getting there if you only devote resources to your one main character."
subject100,0," - i haven't seen any. there's a youtube video (or several) for almost every individual level if you want to fully clear each level. but in terms of overall strategy, your best bet seems to be these boards."
subject100,0," - agreed completely. i definitely set 7-10 auto battles, put my phone down, and check back in 10 minutes"
subject100,0," - the problem i share with op is that this event, and many of the challenges/rifts, expect a certain team comp. even if you played the first 2 weeks perfectly (saving gems, pulling gachas correctly), you still might be sol if you haven't levelled the right comps or picked the right weapons for your mains. i don't complain too much, because the events aren't going anywhere, and the rewards are mainly cosmetic. but i can appreciate op's frustration."
subject100,0," - i'm not into pvp, but i'd recommend doing a few colosseum fights. win or lose, it takes like 1 minute to use 5 tickets, and you get pretty good ""free"" rewards."
subject100,0," - i hear what you're saying. but that ""frustrating"" team is also pretty low risk and puts you in position to be in your playoffs/competitive. then its up to you, over the course of the season, to make good trades or make good waiver wire moves to upgrade your spots. the low risk means 1 injury isn't going to derail you in the same way that a stars-and-scrubs draft would. imagine spending $65 on cmc, and for whatever reason he isn't a top 5 rb this year. you'd be in big trouble. so i guess its all about how you want to play. you spend a premium for the premium players, but if those guys don't pan out for any reason, the season is basically a wash. or you go the beersheets/value-based-drafting route, and its less likely that you draft 2 top 10 rbs, but your risk profile is much lower."
subject100,0," - that's true to an extent. but you have to spend your money at some point, right? i think the author here is getting at the fact that, in a $200 league, there aren't many ""good"" teams that have 15 $15 guys. because each week you're going to have a big chunk of your roster ""investment"" on the bench. most leagues are structured that you want a few guys in the top tiers. so if you assume that you're going to be spending $100 (or whatever, depending on your league settings) on two guys, you have a sense of how to fill out your other starters. and then when you spend more (or less) than that $100, you can keep in mind how to adjust other bids. and it works vice versa. if you get your wrs 2 and 3 in the first five bids, now you know that some of your budget for your top guys is ""set,"" and to adjust expectations accordingly. so yes, be fluid, and if you can magically get cmc for $30, then great. but i think most auctions play out similarly, and the top 50 guys or so generally go for prices in the 'range' predicted by the experts."
subject100,0," - i think for some players/drafts, it can be helpful if you decide from the outset that you're not spending on qb/te. $25 for mahomes might be a ""steal,"" but i think that you can get in a lot of trouble ""price enforcing"" for a player that you don't necessarily want. value-based-drafting works really well for the most part. but if you spent $50 on mahomes/kittle, you'd be in great shape at qb/te, but you might be only getting 1 other top 20 player, and you might need to severely overpay for the one you want. or you might find yourself getting an rb that you don't really love. if you go in with the bbq strategy, or any other strategy, you might miss out on values at te/qb, or miss out on ""value"" for guys you hate. and that's a downside. but the upside is that you'll probably be in good shape to get the guys ""you like."" and honestly that's one of the major auction selling points i always hear touted. ""get the guys you like."""
subject100,0," - the point wasn't really the dollar value. the point is spending a big chunk of your budget on a top 5 cost guy, and getting nothing from him."
subject100,0," - do we know the likelihood of seeing more ""awakening reset"" stones? i got one in this event (i think), but i don't see it as a reward in many other usual places. i have a few characters that i awakened a bit early in the game that i'd love to grab 5-6 nodes worth of stones back for my main characters. but if awakening reset stones are super-rare, i would rather hold off for now."
subject100,0," - great, thanks. i dumped a ton of resources in my knight at the beginning, not knowing it was sub-optimal. at some point, i'd like to get those stones back, but my knight is still way stronger than any other 4th group member."
subject100,0," - one other thing i found. when he does the purple ball, you run away. that's when he's primed for a teleport attack. i've found that if i keep running (ideally on the diagonal) for a second or two after the purple ball lands, he teleports near me but doesn't land any damage."
subject100,0," - there really isn't a ""dark"" healer. i tried playing karina during the story mode, and she just didn't heal enough for me. so even though it wasn't a pure ""element"" team, i went with favi (and then aoba) for my healer on a team built around lupina/arabelle."
subject100,0, - its such a shame. playing those first few levels with a pet wolf attacking everything as your buddy was a lot of fun :)
subject100,0, - i just cleared the fire slime and was about to jump for joy after dozens of wipes. then marina showed up. fml
subject100,0, - looking for guild. na world 2 cleared story. heavenhold tower 40. orbital tower 175. daily player.
subject100,0," - i don't have any specifics, but i'd check out nearby ski resorts. a few of them work to freeze and maintain ponds nearby."
subject100,0," - just a note - assuming you haven't spent coins on stamina. if you just buy the non-stamina items, you will have enough coins."
subject100,0," - i didn't say don't buy stamina. i said if you want to afford everything else, don't buy stamina. that being said, i'd personally rather not buy stamina, because i don't think you get enough stamina ""bang for your buck"" for those purple coins. purple coins are a limited resource, and 5-10 stamina (which maybe equates to 1-2 rare evo stones in a rift run) doesn't feel worth it. also, not everyone has multiple natural 3* units. they might be using/trying out those 2* basic units."
subject100,0," - honestly, the math is hard. evo stone boxes can give a range of 24-72 stones. plus, stamina doesn't have a uniform coin cost (eg. 5 screws gives 8 stamina, but 5 books give 10 stamina). so if you get the 24-stone opening, then yes, its a bad use of coins. but assume an average outcome (say 50 stones), then its 1 coin for 1 stone buying the box. with the upside of a smaller set of hero possibilities (albeit no rares), which can be good and bad. so not a great ratio, but not terrible for early characters, or for characters close to a evolution-up situation. its also hard to gauge stamina=stone conversion if you're running rifts early in the game. you seem like an end-game player, so your stamina calculation of 3-starring lvl 70 rifts is very different from a new player 2-starring a level 20 rift. you're getting way more evo stones per stamina than someone relatively new to the game. and its easy to say ""save everything until end game,"" but that can be really challenging for f2p players, and it can make the game much slower on the front end (meaning less progress in events, pvp, guild stuff, etc.)."
subject100,0," - lowest one. so you want to level up all 3 (food, drink, games) at the same rate."
subject100,0," - generally no. awakening stones and hero stones are probably the most limited resource in the game. i think if those 2star units were evolved to 4 or 5 stars, it might be worth it. but otherwise, i'm saving awakening stones and limit breaking just natural 3 stars."
subject100,0," - i hope the mods sticky this. really great advice, and even better presentation/clarity. many thanks!"
subject100,0," - i'm not the best source for future patches. but i read somewhere that in the future, there's going to be a ""weapon exchange"" system, where you can trade in a 5-star weapon for another (obviously with limits). i might go for bari, then, since it might be easier to get armada in the future. plus, thinking of it like this: i'd rather have a team of marina + bari  amp; ex, as opposed to a team of marina  amp; ex + 3 randoms (with one using bari's weapon)."
subject100,0," - i'm at a level 7 inn, so i have every spot filled. pretty soon, i'm going to be deleting some of my 1-star buildings to replace with 3-star buildings. so i'd suggest not levelling up your 1-star buildings more than you need to stay in green, since most/all of them will get replaced later."
subject100,0," - and there's a lot of different ways to play. so much of the discussion is how to optimize your team for arena/colosseum. but there's plenty of other parts of the game - towers, challenge missions, orbital lift, guild events - that don't get the same attention. so even if what you're doing might not work for pvp, it might work for other stuff."
subject100,0," - heavenhold tower 40 - how am i supposed to keep the rest of my party alive? obviously when the boss is keying up an attack, don't lead the attack onto someone else. but 99% of the time, the ai just stands on the boss and gets one-shot. maybe i need to l2p and just solo all 3 bosses, but i'm not good enough to dps for 10 minutes straight without taking damage."
subject100,0, - i did the same thing. that's about the best you can do. the only thing i didn't see was how you're increasing stamina. spending purple coins/gems on stamina speeds that up.
subject100,0, - how far along have you progressed in the pve story?
subject100,0," - i think your second team makes sense. you may not have skills lined up perfectly, but if you level the second team, you have a different team comp/skill set to throw at fights your dark team can't handle well (e.g., a fight where a tank makes a big difference). could swapping a healer (e.g., favi for aoba) help line up skills? the element type wouldn't line up (earth vs water), but i honestly find that my healers are the weakest for dps anyways."
subject100,0," - you're going to get a ton of equipment finishing up the quests/levels. plus, you're going to be getting a lot of new characters as you progress through the game. no need to grind equipment yet. if you have enough gold, one option is to do ""random evolution"" with weapons. for instance, you take 2 1-star items and get a random 2-star item."
subject100,0," - do you have a ""unique"" character yet - i.e., one of the characters that starts as a 3-star unit? if so, spending energy on the auto-rift farming evolution stones for that unit is the best use of your energy. the most important thing is to have a 3-star unit evolved to a 5-star unit (and then building a team around that unit). so you want to be getting evolution stones for them as quick as you can."
subject100,0," - its too bad sharp/vernon are so gambling focused. sharp has a lot of useful football knowledge, but i also don't gamble much so a lot of the content is also lost on me."
subject100,0," - honestly, shea is such a good dude that if you just dm him on twitter or something like that, he might respond."
subject100,0," - yeah, its a huge grind. something like a month or so to get a unit to 5 stars. if you really feel short on gear, the shop has some mediocre gear pieces. if you just need 1-2 pieces here and there, its better to spend gold (which is basically infinite) vs stamina (decidedly finite) on the item dungeon. then you can always spend hammers to push them up to your level, or evolve them into a 4-star or 5-star item."
subject100,0," - i'm no expert, so you're probably right about aoba. i haven't run an earth time. i'm currently rounding out my dark team of lupina, arabelle, vampire girl and knight (which i stupidly 5-starred and limit broke to 65 before i knew about being efficient in this game)."
subject100,0," - great guide, though the ""get good wifi"" triggered me a bit :d. i might just wait until i can push my main to 68 (plus whatever new level caps come in the patch). right now its just too frustrating to dps for so long without mistakes. maybe if i had a gamepad..."
subject100,0," - generally the consensus is that plit is great at pve content (the missions, rifts, events), but meh for pvp content (colosseum and arena). so that might factor into your decision. another consideration - do you like playing nari more or plit more? i started playing as the knight as my main - i've since switched to lupina. the knight plays with melee weapons; lupina is a caster. i've enjoyed playing as lupina. if someone told me the knight was 5-10% better than lupina, i think it wouldn't have changed my decisoin."
subject100,0," - i've been told ""always evo dungeon."" you get plenty of items from missions, events, the pve story, etc. you don't get nearly enough evo stones from that sort of stuff."
subject100,0, - thanks for the vote of confidence!
subject100,0," - i generally run some form of your positioning (or maybe all dps on the back row). i find that works well, especially on defensive fights. i'm running a dark team of arabelle, lupina, knight and vampire girl. i'm finding pretty good success with it. arabelle definitely gets a bit stronger when you can load up on fellow dark units, since many of their awakenings boost dark damage. she also benefits a lot from her ex. whether her ex or lupina's ex is preferable - hard call. i'd pick whichever one has a worse weapon as an alternative?"
subject100,0," - yeah, its crazy that some people have 4 5stars, but remember some people dump hundreds or thousands of dollars into this game. i have 2 5-stars (lupina and knight), and i'm 400/840 to arabelle. i spend all my excess stamina on evo dungeons. after i 5star arabelle, i'll still probably focus on the hero/evo dungeons honestly. i like having some flexibility for unit choice (e.g., building an earth team with a proper tank) vs going for mirror dungeons. mirror dungeons feel very much like something for big spenders to stay busy with."
subject100,0," - it might just be bad luck for you. i've been a bit higher than 1.4. i think it might have to do with streakiness? it feels like i've had more 3-unique stone runs, and more 0-runs."
subject100,0," - that's what i did, and i enjoyed it. especially if you can get arabelle during this event. they're both dark, and synergize well together."
subject100,0," - when you're in the summon ""tab,"" you see ""pickup hero summon,"" with a white arrow on either side. so you can cycle between 3 choices - bianca, arabelle, or basic. bianca and arabelle have the higher rates for their respective banners (vis a vis other heroes). the basic banner has a uniform rate for all heroes. no matter which of the 3 options you choose, it doesn't change your chances of getting a unique character. it only changes your odds of getting a specific hero."
subject100,0," - some weapons/abilities travel the entire map and ignore walls. i used lupina - her regular wolf attack only goes about halfway across the map, so it was useless. but her special ability goes across the whole map, so i was able to wipe out the enemies using 2-3 special attacks."
subject100,0," - craig is definitely a 2star viable character as a tank. a week ago or so there was a post on the boards about some guy who brought a craig+3 other 2star units to top 100 in the arena. i don't know how viable yuze is as a tank. she can only wield a two-hander, meaning no shield/trinket to boost tank stats. but she has a lot of early green awakening stones, so if she was moderately awakened, she'd be solid. not sure if she's really a ""tank"" though."
subject100,0," - depends. is it a character you'd like to have/use eventually? if not, i'd prob turn it into magic metal. an ex weapon is nice for characters to use, but its not necessarily better than another 5-star green weapon if you don't get the ex benefit. my approach is that, i'm never going to limit break more than 1-2 weapons in the coming months, because i don't spend a ton of money. i'd rather focus on limit breaking weapons for my 2 most ""levelled"" characters, which the magic metal helps with."
subject100,0," - i'm no expert in this game, but i think the consensus is that bari + ex is better than plit + ex. plit is good in pve, but not good in pvp. i'd probably limit break the weapon, and mileage bari."
subject100,0, - that's right.
subject100,0," - yeah, i'm the same. i do pvp mainly for the free gems and the various tokens. but i don't care too much about my rank."
subject100,0," - i don't have a max-level 5* geared yuze, so i'm no expert. but craig's base stats are much ""tankier"" (25.8k hp, 199 def, 32 dmg red). yuze is 20.2k, 142 def, 12 dmg red. plus, as i mentioned, yuze's weapons are going to do a lot less as a ""tank"" than craig. but, on the other hand, this game doesn't really require a ""tank"" in the sense of the usual mmo context. there might be a few orbital lifts where its helpful. so while craig is more survivable, yuze does a lot more damage, and might have ""enough"" survivability. you may have seen that next patch is going to have a 3-star ""dark"" tank. just food for thought."
subject100,0," - i'd even go 1 step further on your points about the status of your ""main 4"". i think having a team of 4 is obviously a priority, but i think stopping at 4 geared/leveled units isn't enough, depending on team composition. right now, i'm running a lupina/arabelle dark team, which is ranged-heavy and has no tanks. once this team is limit-broken and mostly awakened, i'm definitely going to 5-star a tank and a few melee, because there are plenty of orbital tower levels, heavenhold, etc. levels that are basically impossible with my current team."
subject100,0," - sort of. typically, you spend your efforts levelling up and getting evolution stones for a 3star hero. while getting those 3star hero evolution stones in the rift, you'll get a lot of evolution stones for 2star heros. those heros will likely get to 5-star before or around the same time as your 3-star hero. if they get to 5-stars, they're likely worth levelling."
subject100,0, - it only counts if you go bardownski
subject100,0," - its a bit of a hike, but honey pot hills has great cider donuts. its the best part of apple picking out there."
subject100,0, - http://americanapplianceservices.com/. next day service to repair a washer-dryer combo unit. very up front and honest. highly recommended.
subject100,0," - my biggest gripe with the arena is that the playtimes are very hard to hit for some players. i'm lucky, due to work/real life schedule if i can play arenas once or twice a week. so i'm pretty low-ranked (not that i care) even though i've got a pretty strong main team. so when i do play, i often steamroll, because my lvl 70 5star lupina with ex is up against a level 66 with much less power. i think a lot of players are in this boat. for what its worth, they recently changed how the arena ladder works, so hopefully it will be easier for people like me to move up to the ""right"" bracket, and you'll face more people similarly progressed."
subject100,0," - natural 3 stars are better. but they're also expensive to level. and they can't be levelled simultaneously. you could level lupina to 5star, and while that happens, karina and yuze would also be levelled to 5star (or near to it), because they share the same evo dungeon. so at that point, they'd be stronger than bianca."
subject100,0," - i'm maining lupina now, and she's good in both pvp and pve. definitely not the best for either, but still strong. she also does benefit from a mono team. for a while, i was running lupina, arabelle, knight and aoba. when i swapped aoba for karina, it made a huge difference."
subject100,0," - this is a big part of why the item rift is meh, and its better to spend stamina on evo dungeons. its better, albeit slower, to level stuff up with what you get in events, quests, towers, etc., and get evo stones with excess stamina."
subject100,0," - panda brooch is bad because damage reduction doesn't apply in pvp. so a big chunk of your item ""points"" are wasted for pvp with the mad panda brooch. so stick to minotaur for everything."
subject100,0,"magic metal farming - optimal process? - i'm curious how folks go about acquiring their 300mm per month for their epic exclusives. i've been random evolving all 1, 2 and 3 star items that i receive. but those usually only fall during rift runs, so i don't get too many. after that it seems like the cheapest option is to buy a 3-star weapon from the shop, and then spend $340k gold to evolve to a 5-star weapon. then extract, rinse and repeat. one thing i try to keep an eye on is checking the shop daily for cheap weapons - seems like once a day or so, there's a 3-star weapon for $3k. buying 9 of these weapons and random-evolving to a 4-star weapon is much cheaper than just evolving a 3-star. but that wouldn't be enough to get 300mm each month. thoughts?"
subject100,0," - agreed. i was running arabelle and lupina as well. knight is my third. for awhile i had favi and aoba, and neither really shined. switching to karina really helped my team. my dps jumped much higher (from both her party buffs and her individual dps), and her healing was plenty. that being said, picking one of favi or aoba (i prefer aoba) to be sort of levelled for healing-intensive fights is also a good idea."
subject100,0, - since you seem knowledgeable - do you know the meaning of the auras that sometimes show up around an enemy's feet?

subject100,0," - on the other hand, $18k isn't going to do much to solve the opiod crisis that is leading to most of the homeless/substance/public health problems resulting in the city center being less than ideal."
subject100,0," - this is why i feel like, even once i have enough evo stones, i'll still never run item dungeons. just doesn't seem worth the stamina."
subject100,0," - i just beat it yesterday, after weeks of failing. i ran zero tanks. i think the bosses hit way too hard for a tank to survive. i cleared it with lupina (70 + ex), arabelle (4star + ex), knight (68), karina (5star + ex). basically, the ai is so bad that the character you control is the only unit that will survive the fight. the first boss - the goblin wolf - isn't too bad. if you grab aggro right away, you can kite his charge, land 2 super attacks, and burn him down. the second boss - the lava slime - isn't too hard once you get the pattern down. but your ai characters will almost certainly get killed asap. so its up to you to dodge, dps, dodge, dps, etc. the third boss - marina - is brutal. she has a few different attack styles, one-shots most units, and you only get to practice on her after spending 5+ minutes clearing the other 2 bosses. so its painful. but after a week or so, i got her patterns down and was able to dps her. definitely check out youtube for some guide videos. i didn't find them super-useful, since my 3 non-controlled chars always wiped, but it does show you boss patterns, which is helpful."
subject100,0," - this hh level really sucks. you need a weapon (and a unit that can use it) that let's you move through/over the dummies. i used a rifle that has its special attack launch you through the air (the skill is called aerial fire). you could also level up akayuki (supposedly), since his attack steps through targets. either way, you're likely spending a lot of resources on a one-time unit or weapon. kind of a pain... maybe eugene could do it with her weapon, too?"
subject100,0," - very good rewards, and also not repeatable."
subject100,0," - i find it to be pretty rare unless you're really focused on optimizing just 4 characters. if you're awakening more than 4, levelling up/evolving more weapons, etc., you won't start building up lots of gold until you have your heavenhold inn at level 7 or 8. at that point, you start to save up a bit (but then you sink it into farming magic metals...)"
subject100,0," - agreed. plus, its hard to acquire/level up 3star heros without making substantial progress in the story. so i think putting at least some resources into the knight makes sense so that you can make progress. this assumes f2p though. if you spend money to acquire/powerlevel a 3-star unit, i think just levelling the knight is probably fine."
subject100,0," - exactly. first time i dropped the slime, i was doing a victory dance, yelling, etc. i half-watch my screen as marina slides over and one-shot slices me up... :("
subject100,0," - it was five days in a row, starting last sunday. so it ended thursday. sorry  #128556;"
subject100,0," - depends on if you are close to any prizes for this event that you want. if not, then yeah, save them"
subject100,0," - marvin isn't great as a tank, since he wears fist weapons, which rarely have defensive skills. the knight with a one handed sword and a shield can serve as a tank in a pinch. but neither has a taunt, which makes them have limited use as tanks. if you are going to focus resources on bari, i'd suggest marina."
subject100,0," - hard to say. but generally there are dps/composition tests throughout the lift. for instance, some fights you can't get by without some strong melee units, or ranged units. so yeah, just keep levelling up."
subject100,0," - limit break raises your character's max level. so if you are 66/66 right now, and limit break once, you are 66/67. you now need to spend xp to get 67/67. so the second sentence you posted is correct."
subject100,0, - what do you mean uncertainty? i think the consensus is that most players have a dozen or so option stones laying around. sk you can use those to get the minotaur necklace to the right element.
subject100,0," - well, i think its hard to expect rolling for ideal stats. but my approach was, if i could get the right element (1 in 6 change, i think?), and get mid-tier other stats, i'd be happy. i also had like 20 option change stones, since i rarely use them. my roster definitely impacts my decision: i run lupina, arabelle, karina and knight (soon to be ogma). so if i had a good +dark minotaur necklace, then i'd have 3+ units that could use it effectively."
subject100,0, - yes. i think you need 700 hero crystals to get to 71 for 1 character.
subject100,0," - you get hero crystals a few ways: 1. random rewards (quests, events, etc). those are few and far between though. 2. unit summons. if you summon a unit you already have, you get hero crystals instead. 3. extra evolution stones. if you 5star a unit, every time you get another evolution stone for them, you can trade them in for hero crystals in your inventory (80 duplicates of normal heros; 40 duplicates of unique heroes). you can definitely keep saving for oghma. he will never go away. but for the next 2 weeks, you have much higher odds if you try to summon him on his banner."
subject100,0," - if you want to make oghma your main character (and there's no reason not to), then its not a terrible idea to try for his weapon. if you're relatively new though, it might make more sense to pull for more characters. then, once you save up 300 mileage, you could just buy oghma's weapon. oghma and arabelle will be a good combo team. i'm going to run a dark team of those two, plus lupina and karina."
subject100,0," - as laana notes, its not that you need more unique heroes. really, you only need 1, as you can only level 1 hero up in the evolution dungeon rift at a time. your main goal for the game is generally: 1. level up your main character. 2. evolve your main character to 5 stars through evolution dungeons. 3. limit break your main character 5 times. 4. rinse and repeat with other characters. some folks level up a few units at the same time. other folks focus on the story and other side events, because they haven't received their main character yet. it also depends on how much money you spend, or if you're free-to-play."
subject100,0," - i run karina, lupina, and arabelle, and its a really good team for pve. lots of dps, and if you stay active and dodge stuff, karina's heals are plenty. i just pulled oghma, and plan on levelling him up for the 4th (right now i use the knight). once you start awakening these 3, they have really good synergies. a lot of party +dark attack nodes that benefit your whole team. so i'd think you could keep up good dps even if you dropped bianca. i'd prob mileage either lupina's or ohgma's weapon. likely lupina, since ohmga's weapon is on banner and should be easier to get."
subject100,0, - i don't think we know until thursday? when it launches in korea?
subject100,0, - depends on the rest of your team. marina is overall probably better/more versatile. mechwarrior is better if you have other dark units.
subject100,0," - honestly not sure. i'd think the dps' weapon would be more important than a tank, but i don't know. i think replacing yuze makes sense, especially since yuze is likely to be 5-star pretty quickly once you start farming evolution stones for arabelle and/or oghma. once you get those two geared and levelled, then over time you can swap in lupina or someone else."
subject100,0," - depends on for what. its not worth it if you just want to maximize hero crystals. but generally yes, its a good idea."
subject100,0, - it did once or twice for me. seems stable now.
subject100,0," - i liked arabelle, lupina, karina (vampire girl) and knight. just pulled omgha, and will eventually swap him out. if you used marina with those 3, you'd be in good shape too."
subject100,0," - at some point build a few different element teams. but unless you spend a ton of money, you will need to focus on 1 team for awhile."
subject100,0," - its there. click into the oghma's tree thing. then on the left side of the screen, there's an ""event mission"" box."
subject100,0," - agreed. which is why i said only for hcs its not worth it. you get gold, xp, etc when you're running evo dungeons."
subject100,0," - if we're just talking hc, which was my point, gems are best used for pulls. 2700 gems gets you about 38 hc if you don't pull a new unit. 2700 gems, at best if you buy the 100 stamina pack a day, gets you 1350 stamina, which gets you 135 evo runs. assuming you 3-star the 17.1x runs, you average 1.4 unique stones, and 15.7 normal stones. over 135 runs, you get 189 unique stones (for 4.725 hc) and 2119.5 normal stones (for 26.49 hc). so you lose out on 8 hc. i'm not saying you're wrong that buying stamina is worth it most of the time. but if you just want hero crystals, you're better spending gems on pulls."
subject100,0," - gotcha. i thought you meant the daily mission's of ""participate 3 times in arena,"" etc."
subject100,0, - probably marina. more versatile.
subject100,0," - i think lupina is overall better than yuze. she's a unique character (base 3star), and has a really nice dps attack and special attack (it passes through units - so you can line up enemies for some nice dps; and it passes through obstacles, which is really nice for arena). she is also technically a melee attack at range, which can be very convenient. the downside to lupina is that you can 5-star yuze while levelling up oghma and/or arabelle. you can't get stones for lupina while levelling up those 2. so i'd use yuze while farming evolution stones for oghma and arabelle, and then make lupina my 3rd ""focus"" unit to power up once you have oghma and arabelle at 5-star."
subject100,0, - do arena and colosseum whenever you can. spend purple coins and gems on stamina packs. don't miss the 2 daily log-in awards. 3-star your awakening dungeons.
subject100,0," - i feel the same way. i think its done, though, because at the end of 6-3 she wakes up. its also strange that there's no award for 100%-ing the entire world, so maybe they add more later?"
subject100,0, - don't forget schools (not just colleges) are back in session.
subject100,0," - yes, random-evolve them up to higher levels. ultimately you can use 5star random evolves to get free magic metal. which you can then use to open the magic metal boxes for some unit-exclusive weapons."
subject100,0," - i'd stay dark, and focus on levelling up your current 4. then i'd try to get ohgma (also dark) and his ex. that way you'd have 5 characters all with really good synergy, and you could swap out as needed depending on the fight."
subject100,0," - i'm stuck on it too. my general strategy (not working yet) is focusing on burning down the general. if i can get him killed, no matter what, i can slowly dps down just the slime if its just me left."
subject100,0," - maybe, but any team comp is going to have weaknesses. if you want to be top 100 arena/colosseum, then maybe take the 'meta' into account. but if you want to progress through the game relatively easily, i think a mono dark team is going to be just fine."
subject100,0," - not sure about ohgma yet, as i haven't seen him yet, or levelling mine up enough. i like lupina, as she's pretty tanky, and she is good at kiting, as her attacks pass through walls. but vish/eugene are both really good in arena. if you can get into range, you can shred nearly any ranged unit."
subject100,0," - honestly, any hero. its a tough level, but its a bit of a skill check. i used lupina, and her advantage was that her special skill attack goes across the whole screen. which means that sometimes the attack hits the laser towers. so over time, i was able to knock out 2-3 of the towers, and that really made the level easier. i think your best bet is to keep using your best units, because you want to burn down the boss quickly. one other thing i found helpful was to never get too far away from the boss. if you imagine the boss being the middle of a compass, i found it best to stand nw, ne, sw, or se of him. so he never hits you with his punch attack, but he also never teleports behind you."
subject100,0, - i always read minotaur's necklace.
subject100,0," - out of order, but: 3. if you're mostly f2p, its crazy trying to predict the meta. its a month+ to get a character near-max. so this option's out. 2. do you have either marina/oghma? seems a bad idea to mileage an ex without the character. 1. that's a lot of ranged dmg. if you really are more pve focused (so orbital lift, towers, kamazone), you might hit some roadblocks that don't favor that comp. would eugene be your quasi-tank?"
subject100,0," - i'm going to be in the same boat, but with ara/lup/karina/oghma. honestly, i think i don't mind. i'm going to be swapping out the knight, so its going to be overall such a large improvement. and i usually find that i'm very rarely 4-chaining and it makes a difference in a fight. in colosseum and very hard tower fights, one of the ai is usually dying before i can get off even 1 4-chain. so my overall theoretical max dmg/stun time is lower, but i think the improvement in the rest of my gameplay will make up for it."
subject100,0," - hmm. and would you spend money to power up marina, ohgma or tinia? eugene already being 5-stars makes me think she should be in your roster for now, regardless of who you pick. so bari, nari and eugene, plus one of those three?"
subject100,0," - agreed. i feel that games with this mix-match option usually end up in two places. 1. the ""unique and cool"" cards are so niche and watered down that you'd never really use them, and they just become more item bloat. 2. the cards are so op that the card system becomes its own meta. games have definitely threaded the needle between 1 and 2 to make cool card-like mechanics, but its hard. given that the game is still building out its character roster and pve structure, i don't know if its a good use of developer/tester time. still plenty of low-hanging fruit for this game to take advantage of."
subject100,0," - i agree that having the same stat cards is boring, but when you have 12 (or more) units that might want those +atk cards, what's the alternative? swap out cards every time you're changing characters?"
subject100,0, - agreed. step 1 of this system is overhauling the card interface.
subject100,0," - i think it could be cool, like brawlstars, if there are character-specific cards. kind of highlighting how certain units play, and give them a card that either highlights a unique playstyle, or fixes one of the ""holes"" that such a character might have."
subject100,0," - i'm dealing with the same issue, and compounded worse because my knight is lvl 68. i think having a strong knight is still valuable, especially for event rifts (20% boost every event) and kamazone (at some point you need fighters outside your main 4). i think next reset stone i get, i'm going to reset my knight, but refill probably 1/3 or half of his nodes. then i'll get a decent boost of stones, but the knight will still be pretty strong. plus one thing to keep in mind that awakening stones are getting a lot more plentiful if you consistently do kamazone, and as you buildup your heavenhold shop."
subject100,0, - no. better to 3-star a lvl 60 vs 2-star a lvl 70.
subject100,0," - but you wouldn't, really. you'd give your top 4 units your best cards. then, if you're running your next 4 (for a guild fight, or for kamazone), you aren't using your crappy cards/changing your decision. you're just swapping out your best cards before a fight. which is not fun. i guess there's a decision point if you only have 3 10% atk cards and 3 dps units on your main team. sure, you have to balance ""do i give 2 to 1 unit, or 1 to each."" but that's not a terribly fun decision, and i suspect that, since its percentage base, you're always giving your best cards to your most developed unit."
subject100,0," - ""not the quarry, but the chase. not the laurel, but the race."""
subject100,0," - that's the truth of it. which is why i find it crazy with all these posts about ""what should my team be"" for new players that just pulled 3-5 uniques. don't worry about your ""team"". worry about one character at a time. level that character. then see how the game changed in the month that has passed."
subject100,0," - true. but they're definitely the least ""bang for your buck"" when you're deciding which awakening nodes to prioritize."
subject100,0," - let's also not forget that the clerk's office is basically rolling out an entirely new project during a pandemic. i'm sure their resources are stretched pretty thin trying to process all of the mail-in ballot requests. not that its an excuse, but i'm certainly not surprised that the first time the city tries to dramatically increase its mail-in ballot program, there are errors."
subject100,0," - i have lupina for my dark team: lupina, ara, karina and knight (4star ohgma should be ready to slot in in a week or so). she's very good in colo if you line up your units correctly, because her attack passes through all units (so you can hit all 4 enemies if lucky). she's not good in arena, though. if you plan on going dark, i think its a no-brainer to add lupina, though it will take awhile unless your ara is already 5-star."
subject100,0," - depends on your team comp, and your playstyle, and how much you pay. if you are free-to-play, you're looking at aleph being a useful character in about 6 weeks..."

subject100,0,"window replacement - i live in an old house (pre-1900) that has a lot of windows. most are a uniform size, but a few unique ones (compared to the rest of the house). further, some have been replaced over the years (not sure exact dates - we've been here less than 5 years). at some point, i'd like to replace at least some of the windows. some don't close tightly. some are rotting a bit. some feel drafty. i'm curious what the best practices for shopping around are. i read the wiki, but it didn't go into a few things: 1. is it better to replace everything all at once? do contractors provide any economies of scale for bigger projects? 2. is there a time of year that's best to engage contractors? i'm in the northeast, so i've likely missed the installation window (no pun intended) for 2020, but maybe this is the time of year contractors line up 2021 jobs? 3. i'm curious about the process. when i think of installing windows, does the contractor remove and re-install any curtains or window treatments? some of the other posts about window installation focus on making sure clean-up is the installer's job, but is there anything else that needs to be mentioned when shopping prices? 4. since its an old house, some of the windows are surrounded by moldings. would the window installer typically touch up or replace any issues found in the window frame? i haven't seen any signs of rot, but i wouldn't be surprised if taking some of the windows out uncovered issues like rot. any and all comments are appreciated. thanks!"
subject100,0," - yeah, sometimes if i'm going to bed, or going to be afk for awhile, i'll use the feature. i'd rather spend 5-10 gems to start a long build and have it run overnight. i'd much rather make the ""destroy building"" button hidden somewhere. i find that's much more likely to get mis-clicked."
subject100,0," - how much do players care about ""toughness."" it seems like toughness is some sort of aggregate of hp, def and dmg reduction, but its not clear to me how much i should prioritize a ""tough"" hero. the question comes up because my 4th character is a lvl 68 knight that's probably 60% awakened. i pulled ohmga and its currently 66, 4star, and 75% awakened. i'm unclear when the tipping point for ohgma being a better choice as my 4th choice. i suspect its ""get ohgma to 5 stars,"" but maybe i'm missing something."

subject1006,0,"na 3rd seed vs cn 3rd seed - when looking at the way the pool structure is setup currently, na's 3rd seed is in pool 3, while china's 3rd seed is in pool 2. historically, this has made sense. china's teams generally fare far better than north america's at international tournaments, and thus they deserve higher seeding for their performance. however, as of this year's msi, this may be challenged. na placed in 2nd, while china and lms held 3rd  amp; 4th. because of this, should na have gotten a better placement for their #3 seed? yes and no. the issue comes in where some people may believe that na deserves the better 3rd seed spot instead of china, due to said msi performance. the counter argument to this is that the performance of the #1 team from a region should not influence the placement of a #2 or #3 spot. however, i think there may be a solution found at this year's worlds. what if the performance of the 3rd seed teams at this year's worlds decide the placement for next year's worlds, specifically for 3rd seeds? for example, cn 3 does far better than na 3rd seed, then the setup would be kept as it is now. however, if say c9 does better than imay, then for next year's worlds the placement of na #3 and cn #3 will be reversed in terms of pool placement. note: the reason i have only mentioned this for na and cn #3, and not kr, is because kr placed #1 at msi. this does bring me to my last point though: as i'm writing this, i realize this could open possibilities to other regions switching placements of different seedings. example, if splyce outperforms ahq should eu #3 swap with #2 lms? this and other examples are why i'm typing this, to see if people on reddit have insight you can share about this. what other things am i missing, and what solutions are there to this and those issues? **tl;dr:** world's pool placement for #3 seeds may be outdated and in need of an update, especially considering msi 2016 results."

subject1006,0,"[civ v] add an option to plunder a city instead? - this has been on my mind for a while, not sure if i missed something or mods like this already exist, but i wanted to pitch a suggestion and see other people's thoughts. **tl;dr:** add a new option when capturing a city that let's you pillage it for gold and great works, without taking it over completely. i've noticed in my civ v games that for one reason or another, i don't necessarily want to capture a city from another civilization. maybe my empire is already big enough, maybe it's the warmonger penalty, but i want to still gain benefits from sieging a city. thus, how about a fourth option in the list when you capture a city, entitled ""sack the city"". this option would give you a large amount of gold and the ability to steal great works from the city, while still leaving it within the control of the original owner and giving you a lesser warmonger penalty. this could also destroy the city's walls or defenses, leaving it susceptible to future assaults and sacks. the reason people might choose this over razing a city is a guaranteed lesser warmonger penalty, but also the long term benefits of weakening an enemy city. this feature could give a large amount of gold immediately after being sacked while reducing future gold gains for pillagers until x amount of time passes, at which point the city returns to prime plunder opportunity while still possibly being weakened (depending on how much resource/gold the owner puts back into it), thus allowing you to raid it again for more gold later on. view it as an alternative long term benefit to taking a city over simply capturing it and razing it once. stealing all of the great works might be too op, so perhaps maybe only 1/2 or 1/4 of the ones in the city, providing an incentive to return? what are your thoughts?"
subject1006,0,"what are the countries  amp; politics in witcher 3? - i'm relatively new to the entire witcher franchise, having picked up w3 a few weeks ago and still on my first play-through of it. i love this game, and it really does make me feel like a skilled monster hunter when i take down something i spent time preparing for. however when i look at the map and hear the different names and countries, i have absolutely no clue what anyone is talking about. what's the difference between velen and novigrad? who is this emperor dude, why is he occupying something, and why does no one like it? what are the countries and what's the main conflict that isn't just finding ciri? if this is dependent on what point in the game i'm at, i've [potential main story spoiler](/s ""cleared novigrad, skellige, and velen, in looking for ciri, and am on my way back to the baron to try and collect uma."") edit: tried to fix spoiler text, hopefully more visible on mobile now"

subject1019,0," - wait, does the manga ever imply that levi might be gay?"
subject1019,0, - i still don't get why she just gave up and let herself be killed :(
subject1019,0," - sure, but why would she help them? even if she does feel guilt for marcel's death, she's also the one who said she would live for no one but herself. it doesn't make much sense for her as a character to do that; it's kind of what she criticized krista for doing, and she acknowledges it! and i'm not sure i get what you meant at the end there, reiner and bertolt went after eren and probably would go after historia too afterwards, regardless of ymir giving herself up. anyway, the warriors' failure was not actually dismissed by marley. reiner almost lost his titan power (and life) because of it."
subject1019,0,"[manga spoilers] does anyone else notice some similarities between snk and fullmetal alchemist? - so i've been thinking about this ever since i started reading snk, and i think there's quite a few more similarities besides the generic shonen ones like most the cast being part of the military, both protagonists having a rare power that sets them apart, and the government hiding a dark secret from the people. i've listed some more specific similarities below; also it's been a long time since i've read/watched fma so forgive any mistakes i made about it. - both the protagonists' mothers die when they're kids; carla's death is violent and traumatising for eren while trisha's attempted ressurection is violent and traumatising for ed. - both the protagonists' fathers go missing when they're kids and both have some forbidden knowledge about the secrets of the world. - other similarities between their parents: trisha and carla wear similar clothing and hairstyles, and van hohenheim and grisha wear similar clothing, glasses, hairstyles and beards. both mothers are stay-at-home moms while both fathers are men of science (grisha being a doctor and van hohenheim an alchemist). also grisha sounds like trisha lol - eren loses a leg while trying to fight the titans and loses an arm while trying to save armin; ed loses a leg while trying to ressurect his mother and loses an arm while trying to save al. - both manga have antagonists that look like humans but aren't (homunculi and titans), and both methods used to create them involve killing people (the sacrifices used to create philosopher's stones and the serum used to transform eldians into titans). - the trio of protagonist, his sibling and childhood friend: eren, mikasa and armin and edward, alphonse and winry. one of the other two members of the trio is the protagonist's love interest (well, more like eren is mikasa's love interest lol). also both trios have the same initials if you turn w for winry upside down. - while there are no obvious similarities between mikasa and winry, armin's personality reminds me a bit of al. i don't recall if al was ever portrayed as a coward like armin was at the beginning of the manga, but i think both of them have a much more calm and peaceful way of dealing with conflict compared with ed and eren, who are brash and irritable. that's all i could think of, if any of you guys noticed other similarities, or have some theory about why they exist, please tell me!"
subject1019,0," - i agree that they're very different stories, but i do think they have enough in common for it to be noticeable. side note, just remembered another similarity: everybody has german or kind of germanic sounding names in both snk and fma"
subject1019,0, - i don't get what you mean by that lol

subject1019,0," - if i'm not mistaken, there's a concept in philosophy similar to what you're describing called ""philosophical zombie"", you might want to look it up"

subject1019,0, - maybe it was a livestream
subject1019,0,"can my laptop cpu be replaced? (i'm almost sure it's socketed and not soldered.) - so i've been wondering if i should upgrade my old laptop's cpu because i frankly don't have the money to buy a brand-new one, and probably won't have it in the near future either. according to what i've been reading online, laptop cpus can't be upgraded because they're usually soldered onto the motherboard. however i'm almost sure mine is not soldered on: my laptop's service guide pdf has a section on maintenance procedures and it says the cpu can be removed by unlocking it from the mainboard socket and lifting it. in this case, i should be able to replace it, right? if yes, which cpu should i replace it with? my laptop is an acer aspire 5333 with an intel celeron p4600 cpu. according to [this](http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/cpus/intel/mobile_celeron_dual-core/p4600.html): ""the p4600 is based on arrandale core, and it requires socket g1. there are also 20 arrandale parts that work in the same socket."" so would any of these 20 cpus really work with my laptop?"
subject1019,0," - thanks! so getting an i7 is a bad idea? both the i7-620m and 640m are socket type pga988, i was thinking about getting either one of them"
subject1019,0," - i've actually found someone on userbenchmark.com who has the same laptop as mine with an i5-520m. but i think i'll try contacting the manufacturer nonetheless, thank you!"
subject1019,0," - thanks, i hadn't thought of that. but i don't think that just the price of the cpu would amount to much, considering all the compatible ones are very old at this point. as to how much i'd spend on it, i'm not sure if it helps since i live in brazil, but i've found an i5-560m for r$ 170, and i guess i could spend up to double that amount. when you say i could risk damaging it, do you mean the cpu or the motherboard though? or both? if it's just the cpu i just use my old one and live with having wasted money, however damaging my motherboard would be pretty bad lol"

subject1019,0," - what did they cut out from the torture scene? aside from hange's ""which testicle do you need the least"""
subject1019,0,"[manga spoilers] so at what point in the story do you think season 3 will end? - i've read that it's pretty much confirmed that season 3 will be two 12-episode cours, so based on the pacing of events in the anime, and the fact that episode 8 will be titled ""outside the walls of orvud district"", my guess is that the first cour will wrap up the uprising arc, maybe with one episode dedicated to keith shadis' story, and end with the survey corps on the way to retake wall maria. then the whole battle of shiganshina will take up most of the second cour's episodes and the remaining few will show the basement, grisha's flashbacks, etc. probably they'll end it with a scene or two teasing the events and new characters of the marley arc. what do you guys think?"
subject1019,0," - i think that wouldn't be such a huge reveal as it was to manga readers, since we've already seen ymir's flashback on season 2. most anime-onlies probably have already figured out that there's humans living beyond the walls"
subject1019,0," - yep, i was thinking that too"
subject1019,0, - why did he lose it?
subject1019,0," - that's probably the best and most obvious way to end it, right? i mean, i'd be surprised if they did anything too much different from that."
subject1019,0," - i can understand robin being mad at marion and wanting to end their relationship, even though i don't think it's the best or most mature reaction, it's not necessarily immoral. but did you miss the part where he abused her? it's not clear if it's just verbal abuse or physical too, but as it's stated he abused her and called her a slut, it looks to me like it's both. that's not a very moral attitude. i agree with your evaluation of the other characters. it seems most people viewed john as good for defending marion and professing his love for her. i don't know if it's cynicism but he seemed morally dubious to me at best, 'cause he could be taking advantage of a woman in a very fragile emotional state. although initially your doubts about marion didn't even cross my mind, after thinking about it and rereading the story, i noticed both her and john are presented pretty much neutrally. there aren't many indications or insights into what their true intentions are, or any of the other characters' for that matter. i guess that's the point? without even noticing it, we project our own moral preconceptions and stereotypes into the actions the characters took. although, i thought that placing the sheriff in third or fourth place would be a consensus, and was really impressed by how some people defended his actions as honoring his part of a fair contract or something. by the way, i'm an entp, my answer was mjrs. the test gave me this result: ""we would expect you to be a happy, well-balanced person who likes people and is liked by others. you question whether many conventional views on morality are valid under all circumstances. men: #160;do we detect a sense of chivalry and idealism under the sophistication?"" so it made sense for me, except for the chivalry part, but after reading your post and realizing i had as much of a reason to question john's integrity as i did marion's, maybe i really do have a little bit of that lol."
subject1019,0, - but how can you know john wasn't just trying to get laid? the test doesn't say much about his true intentions in defending her from robin.
subject1019,0," - my answer was marion, john, robin and sheriff so i agree with you almost completely. i put sheriff after robin because, like you said, his actions are close to rape and even if he didn't physically force her to do anything, i think that's worse than robin beating her, or at least as bad. even if it's not technically rape, it's pretty awful. and i agree with you on john, i'm surprised that not many are dubious of his intentions in suddenly declaring his love for a woman that's just been beaten and rejected by her lover. i think in real life that would be a pretty clear sign of emotional manipulation."
subject1019,0," - i think the lack of info is intentional, and actually integral to the test. for example, most people would view marion as immoral if robin and john were described as murderers or rapists or something. so it's all about keeping it as neutral as possible, i guess. thinking about it now, maybe the test would be much better if it replaced the names of robin hood characters with generic ones, 'cause we already have a preconception of their personalities. robin hood is the lovable rogue, the sheriff is the bad guy etc. your evaluation of john as pitiful and self-destructive is pretty interesting, i've been reading the comments here and hadn't seen this description before. it makes a lot of sense, although i don't see why you would assume marion has no feelings for him. it's left ambiguous as a lot of stuff is in the test."
subject1019,0," - do you agree with the description the test gave you? and how do you feel being basically the only comment here to view the sheriff character as moral? i understand your rationale, but i can't agree that it was a voluntary contract between him and marion, seeing as he held the freedom and possibly the life of her loved one in his hands. well, actually i'm sleepy and i can't recall if it was her that approached the sheriff with that offer? if it was then i guess it's a little better for him than if he approached her. but still i would consider it very immoral."
subject1019,0," - right, he's the only one whose morality or honesty i ain't sure about."
